10185	 the common reading,  , having no suitable meaning, Ermerins did right in altering this clause, agreeably to the suggestion of Wigan.
 either   or something else seems to be wanting in this sentence.
1 The common reading, instead of  , is  ; in Kühn's edition,  . The reading I have introduced seems to me self-evident.
2 Ermerins does right in substituting this word for  . See, in particular, Pollux, and the note of Fëos, Oec. Hippocrat., under this word. It was a sort of ladle.
 The common reading in all the editions, except that of Ermerins, is  .
 though I have not ventured to change   into  , I have little doubt that the latter (which signifies the knob of a specillum or cautery) is the true reading. See P. ae. vi. 66, 
 Ermerins suppresses   altogether; and seemingly these are superfluous, and unsuitable to this place.
 the common reading is  , which Ermerins has altered to  . It will be seen that, by a less violent change, I have succeeded in amending the text.
 ermerins, following the suggestion of Petit, substitutes this word for  , which is quite unsuitable to the place.
 ermerins suppresses this clause altogether.
3 Ermerins also erases these words, which do not seem to be needed. See, further, Petit and Wigan.
 I wonder that Ermerins should have thought it necessary to expunge these words. It appears to me that, from the commencement of this paragraph down to  , we have one of those long and complicated sentences in which Thucydides, Demosthenes, and other of the great writers of antiquity delighted. This style of composition is very different from the periodic style in which Roman, French, and English authors compose their works. Clarendon, Milton, and Cobbett are the best examples we have, in English, of the old Grecian style of writing in long sentences.
 that this is the true reading, and not  , is quite obvious from Dioscorides, ii. 27. All the   were sea animals. See Appendix to Dunbar's Greek Lexicon.
3 Ermerins, following the advice of Petit, by the addition of  , and slightly altering the punctuation, greatly improves the text in this place. Our author evidently alludes to the celebrated passage in the Epidemics of Hippocrates. See vol.i   360, Syd. Soc. Edit.
 the common reading is  , for which Ermerins proposes to substitute the above, on the authority of a Parisian ms.
 I have not scrupled, in this sentence, to follow Ermerins in substituting   for  , which has no meaning suitable to the place. The passage is still obscure.
 instead of  , Ermerins reads  . I am doubtful.
 Wigan and Ermerins have very properly substituted this word for  . Petit suggests  .
 the common reading,  , being evidently inadmissible, I have preferred the reading adopted by Ermerins, in preference to  , as suggested by Petit, or   as proposed by Wigan.
 hippocrat. Prognost.
 it is so accented in all the mss. and editions.
 wigan has substituted this reading for  .
1 The common reading is  ; which Ermerins alters to  , the meaning of which seems to me very equivocal.
1 Though I have not ventured to alter the text, I must say that I think the true reading would be  , instead of  . I cannot see the significance of the latter, whereas the former is of frequent use with our author as applied to the liver.
 liddel and Scott, conformably to analogy, but in opposition to general usage, read  .
 This word, or some other of similar import, is evidently required in this place, as Petit was the first to suggest. Ermerins does not hesitate to adopt it.
 In the Askew ms. there is a lacuna here, occupying a whole page, but none at the end of the chapter, as in the printed editions.
 ermerins erases  , fancying that the ointment could not be suitable in this place. However, Actuarius recommends the Nardinum Unguentum expressly for Stomachics. Meth. Med. vi. 10.
2 If the text here be sound, the expression must be understood as a strange circumlocution for   or  . See below, in the next chapter. It is worthy of remark, that this mode of circumlocution was much practised by the writers in the Ionic dialect. See Gregorius Corinthus, under  .
 i. pp. 652 — 676, 
 there is evidently something wanting in the text. Petit and Ermerins substitute   after  . I cannot but think, however, that the more natural reading would be  ; meaning, that the remedies in certain cases proved beneficial, and in others not.
1 The common reading,  , is changed by Ermerins to  . I cannot see that this change is any improvement.
 petit, Wigan, and Ermerins are all agreed, that the negative particle, although wanting in the mss., is here required by the sense.
