22595	 the changes in the text here introduced by Ermerins, are absolutely demanded by the confused state of matters as they stand in the mss.
 the common reading is  , which Ermerins alters to  ; but the obvious objection to this emendation is, that it does not account for the omission of   in the common text. On my own authority, I altered the passage as above; but I find that I had been anticipated by Wigan in so far.

2 Ermerins finds great difficulty in explaining the exact meaning of the last sentence. He does not seem to have adverted that our author had in view 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, of the seventh section of the Aphorisms of Hippocrates. See the Commentary of Galen, and the English edition, Syd. Soc. Ed   ii   773. I must say, however, that   seems wanting in this place.
 in place of it. The other, although metaphorical, is quite in the style of our author.
 the sense evidently requires   in place of  , the common reading. See Petit and Ermerins.
 this passage, in all the mss., is confessedly corrupt. I have adopted the conjectural emendation of Ermerins, although very bold, and, I must add, not quite satisfactory.
 i flatter myself that every person who is familiar with the metaphysics of the ancients, will admit that I have improved this sentence by changing   into  . Ermerins, not recognising the difference between the   and the  , expunges   from the text. On the distinction between these portions or powers of the mind, see Aristotle de Anima, iii. 10, etc.; Metaphysica, pluries.
 the text in this sentence is not in a satisfactory state, either as it is, or as altered by Ermerins, who replaces   with  .
 is so.
 it must be admitted, that Ermerins has strong grounds for holding that   is the true reading.
1 Hippocrat. Aph. ii. 42.
 hippocrat. Epid iii.; and Prorrhet. ii.
 The common reading,  , having evidently no meaning, I follow Wigan and Ermerins in adopting this word. I am also indebted to the latter for various other amendments in this chapter, which I do not think it necessary to mention singly.
 although I have not ventured to alter the reading, it appears to me, from the distinction which our author makes above between the cerebral and spinal nerves, that he refers here to the latter, and that we ought to read,  ; or, perhaps, the former word might be dispensed with.
5 Ermerins does not hesitate to substitute   in place of  , as fancying that the sense requires this change.
 this can scarcely be the true reading. Should it not be   ? 
; but it does not seem at all appropriate to the passage.
 at the commencement.
 i am not aware that the term   occurs elsewhere. Hippocrates and Galen, I believe, universally use the substantive  , or the adjective   - the latter being their more common practice.
 etc.
?
 in all the mss. and editions, except that of Ermerins, we read  , which is unsuitable to the place.
 in this place evidently applies to the pulps of the fingers.
 in this passage we are under obligations to Ermerins; in particular for supplying   instead of  . I have not adopted his other alterations.
8 This word is most probably a false reading. See Wigan and Ermerins. The latter reads  , one of Wigan's conjectural emendations.   and   have also been suggested. If I thought myself warranted to make any change in the reading, it would be to adopt  . See Foes, Oec. Hipp.; and Galen, t   pp. 224, 246, ed. Daremberg.
 the change of   into  , as made by Ermerins, is indispensable.
 although not inclined to adopt unauthorised emendations, I must say that I think this reading, on the authority of Ermerins, is a great improvement on the common reading,  . In the mss. of Aretæus, it is quite common to find   written  , by contraction.
 although I have not meddled with the text, I cannot but think that we ought to read either   or  , instead of  .
 surely some such word as   is wanting before  , or the text is otherwise at fault.
 ermerins suppresses the last clause of the sentence altogether, on the ground that it is superfluous and out of place. I fear this must be held to be an unwarrantable liberty on the part of an editor, whose duty it is to restore the words, but not attempt to improve the sense of his author.
2 Ermerins agrees with Petit in reading   I am doubtful.
 p. 482, Syd. Soc. Edit.
 I am not satisfied that Ermerins was warranted in prefixing   to  , contrary to the authority of all the mss.
 i follow Wigan and Ermerins in adopting this reading in place of 
, which would be a very suitable term, as this is a very natural cause of sudden death in asthma.
 hippocrat. de Aliment.
 i have not ventured to eject   from this clause, as suggested by Wigan and practised by Ermerins.
 in most of the editions there is the mark of a lacuna before these words; and Ermerins suppresses them altogether, as being redundant. No lacuna appears in any of our British mss. which I have examined.
 i at first changed  , for which there is no authority in a transitive form, into  . (Ermerins suppresses  , and further reads  , to which, however, there is the same objection as to  ) But, upon second thoughts, by a slight change of the punctuation, I flatter myself that I have brought the text to a passable state.
5 Ermerins substitutes   for  , which latter word evidently is wrong. See Wigan.
 although I have adopted Ermerins' change of   into  , I must say I am still not satisfied with this sentence.
 this sentence is evidently in an unsatisfactory state.
 the text here given, is as amended by Petit and Ermerins. In the mss. it is much vitiated.
 the common reading,  , being evidently at fault, I have not scrupled to adopt the conjectural emendation of Ermerins.
 the common reading,  , having scarcely any meaning. I have adopted that of Ermerins, previonsly suggested by Petit. Wigan reads,  , which also is not unsuitable.
 iii. 22.
  I do not think myself warranted in adopting the text in this place as it is remodelled by Ermerins. Even as altered by him, it appears to me to be in a most unsatisfactory state.
 — 
 i have followed Crassus, Petit, and Wigan in suppressing   before  ; and am surprised that Ermerins should have persisted in retaining the negative.
 i have followed Wigan and Ermerins in adopting this reading, instead of  ; which, however, does not seem to me so unsuitable as they represent.
 this is the reading suggested by Wigan in place of 
 the text is not in a satisfactory state; but yet I cannot bring myself to adopt the multifarious alterations introduced by Ermerins.
 it seems difficult to account for this term being in the nominative, while those of all the other organs are in the accusative; yet we find it so in all the mss. and editions.
7 The text in the last part of this chapter is corrupt. Should we not read   before  ?
 The common reading is  . Petit suggests  ; but Ermerins' reading, as given above, is preferable.
. 
3 The common reading is  , which is evidently faulty. Even as corrected by Wigan and Ermerins, the sentence is still in an unsatisfactory state. See note to the translation.
 dr. Ermerins improves the sense very much by substituting   for  . It is well known that intense thirst and wasting are the characteristics of Diabetes.
 the ordinary reading,  , being evidently faulty, there seems to be no alternative but either to adopt  , as suggested by Wigan, or  , according to Ermerins.
 ermerins reads  , with some show of reason.
 i am so satisfied that the text is corrupt, that for once I felt a strong inclination to adopt the following conjectural reading of Ermerins, although, in the present instance, even he is afraid to admit it into the text: —  . Instead of  , however, I should prefer  .
 i have followed the reading suggested by Wigan, and adopted by Ermerins.   is wanting in all the mss., but seems indispensable.
 359, Syd. Soc. Ed.
 the last four words are added by Ermerins to supply a lacuna in the text. The lacuna is not marked in our British mss.
 ermerins ventures to erase the last three words, and also  , above, from the text.  !
 i cannot but think that the true reading must be  . I do not think myself warranted, however, in making such an alteration without authority. Ermerins reads,  , which does not appear to me to be an improvement.
 ermerins alters the text to  ; but no change seems to be required.
 ermerins reads as follows:   I must say, I cannot recognise the necessity for this alteration, which appears to me anything but an improvement.
 is a Scottish term for stomach. It occurs in Burns' Poems.
 In this sentence I have not hesitated to adopt Petit's suggestion, and have read   in place of  . Ermerins substitutes  ; but for this term he can quote no authority.

3 The text, which is by no means in a satisfactory state, is thus attempted to be emended by Ermerins: —  .
 the common reading is ambiguous. Ermerins reads  . Perhaps our author refers to the bloody discharges from piles, which are not uncommon in old age.
 ermerins reads, on his own conjectural judgment,  , which signifies a sort of Ocular Collyrium.
 Ermerins certainly does appear to improve the clause,  , by transferring them to this place. Formerly the words followed 
 ermerins suppresses this clause. I have merely ventured to add   before  , and altered the punctuation.
4 Ermerins, contrary to all authority, reads  , on the ground that, in ancient times, midwives alone were entrusted with the treatment of diseases of the female genital organs. This, however, was evidently not the case, as must be obvious to any one who has carefully read the Hippocratic treatise on this subject, and the other works contained in the 
 this clause, which had puzzled all the former editors, is expunged from the text altogether by Ermerins.
 I have followed Petit and Ermerins in reading   instead of  . Ermerins further suppresses  .
7 The text here is under great obligations to Ermerins.
 68, etc. 
 i have ventured to read   instead of  , on my own authority; and have substituted   in place of  , on the authority of Ermerins; but have rejected his alteration of   into  , which I think spoils the passage; and have preferred  , which has the authority of the Vatican ms.
 i.e. in the slightest degree. Ermerins refers to Theocritus, Idyll. xiv. 9, for an example of this usage. See further Liddel and Seott's Lexicon, under the word. This usage of it appears very forced in the present instance, and I suspect the reading to be corrupt.
 in the common editions, and I believe in all the mss., we find  , which is obviously at fault, at least as regards accentuation. Ermerins, accordingly, does not hesitate to expunge the term altogether. But to   I can see no objection. It is thus explained in the Lexicon of Hesychius:  . This is sufficient authority for the word, although it is not in common use. See also Liddel and Scott's Lexicon, under the term. There are other difficulties in the remaining part of the sentence, which I cannot bring myself to remove by expunging all the difficult words, after the example of Ermerins.
 Though the text be not in quite a satisfactory state, I prefer leaving it as it stands, rather than adopt the slashing alterations made in it by Ermerins. He reads the last clause thus:  . Wigan merely proposes to read  .

 the common reading,  , has evidently no meaning. Petit and Ermerins try their hands at conjectural emendations, but in such a style as I cannot approve. Petit suggests the following as a probable substitute for the vitiated text:  . Ermerins boldly substitutes the following sentence for the words he expunges:  .
 ermerins ventures to introduce   before  ; and it seems to be required.

 i have here adopted an emendation suggested by Bernard, and received into the text by Ermerins. In the mss. it stands thus:  . No meaning can be drawn from these words.
 the reading in the mss. is  , a word of no meaning. That which we have given was suggested by Wigan and is adopted by Ermerins.
 the common reading,  , has no meaning. The substitute for it was suggested by Petit and adopted by Ermerins.
