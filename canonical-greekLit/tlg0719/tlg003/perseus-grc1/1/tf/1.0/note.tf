20245	  Ermerins ventures to substitute   for this word, for no other reason but because he fancies it more suitable to the passage than the one in the text. Our author has in view Hippocrat. Prognost 
 ermerins, following in the wake of Wigan, suppresses, first, the clause  ; and, second,  , as being mere glosses on the clauses connected with them. I must say, decidedly, that I cannot approve of such editorial practices. If the works of the ancient authorities are to be thus modified agreeably to the tastes and caprices of modern editors, we shall by-and-bye be at a loss to know what is ancient and what modern, in works reputed to be of olden date. And, moreover, although the clauses in question may not be indispensable to the meaning, I cannot but think that they give effect to the other clauses in this passage.
 i.
4 Ermerins erases the clause   altogether. By merely deleting the last word, and   in the following clause, I flatter myself that I have succeeded in emending the text satisfactorily.
 i have partially adopted Ermerins' very extensive alterations of the text in this place.
 the common reading is  , words of no meaning. Petit was the first to suggest  , on which see Foes' Oeconom. Hippocrat. in voce; also Erotian.
 In the original the term   occurs before  ; for which Wigan suggests  , which Ermerins adopts; but, as will be seen, removes it a little way down the sentence.
 ermerins does not hesitate to eject these five words from the text, without any good reason as far as I can see.   applies only to the feet and hands.
 the last clause of this sentence seems decidedly to be corrupt. How much is it to be lamented that this eulogium on wine, which appears to be so judicious and so eloquent, should be marred, in so far, by the corruptions of the text! Petit suggests  , which would be an improvement of the sense, in my opinion; but it is rejected by Ermerins.
 i have adopted   instead of  , as suggested by Petit.
2 Ermerins has entirely remodelled this passage — altering, ejecting, and introducing words, to make his author use the language which the editor fancies he ought to have used. I have adopted only a few of his changes.
3 The reading in most of the mss.,  , has evidently no meaning. Petit mentions, that on the margin of a certain good ms. he found  , which certainly gives a passable meaning, with little violence to the text. Wigan suggests   or  . Ermerins creates a reading to suit his own faney —  . Such a change appears to me utterly inadmissible as being both violent and introducing a meaning not suitable to the place. It will be seen that I have tried my skill in emending this passage — with what success, 
 were the same, or nearly the same, thing.
 Although some words are evidently wanting at the beginning, it is singular that there is no lacuna in any of the British mss.
2 The text is not quite satisfactory; but we cannot venture to adopt the bold alteration introduced by Ermerins:  . The meaning seems to be, that it is the animal heat which imparts life to food introduced into the system.
3 Wigan suggests the necessity of   before  , and Ermerins accordingly adopts it.
 i have ventured to substitute   for  , and   for  . Ermerins changes   into  , and otherwise introduces very many alterations into the text.
 the text is very unsatisfactory.
 the common reading,  , is evidently inadmissible; and although Ermerins changes it into  , I cannot see that even then the text is much improved. I flatter myself that my amendment is both natural and obvious when suggested. See further towards the end of the chapter, where this term occurs.
 104.
 i have adopted the conjectural arrangement of the words introduced by Ermerins.
 the common reading,  , is altered as above by the joint labours of Wigan and Ermerins.
1 Although some words certainly appear to be wanting here and a short distance below, there is no lacuna in either place, in any of our British mss.
1 Ermerins introduces most extensive alterations in this passage; but I have not ventured to adopt any of them. I have merely introduced   after  , which the sense absolutely requires.
 The common reading is  ; but it is clear that the negative cannot stand with the words that follow:  . Ermerins gets over the difficulty by suppressing the last three words. I have effected the same purpose by merely suppressing the negative  . I have adopted his reading of   in place of  , in the same sentence.
 though I have not ventured to alter the text, I cannot but think that we ought to read  . For in   and  , it surely is thought that the spirit for a time leaves the body — not that the body leaves the spirit. In the Iliad, the act of swooning is thus described:   (v. 696); upon which words the scholion is,  .
 compare Williams on Pneumonia, Encyel. of Med., t. iii. 435.
 hippocrat. de Aliment.; Fëos, t   435.
5 There is something inexplicable in this paragraph; for not only does no one of the other authorities recommend brains in the treatment of Pleurisy, but also no one says anything of roasting the brains of swine in their cauls. I suspect the text must be corrupt.
 the common reading is  , for which Wigan and Ermerins properly substitute  . I have made a few more alterations of my own, in justification of which, see Nonnus, Epit. 129.
 Ermerins, on the authority of one Parisian ms., reads  , to avoid the recurrence of aspirates. The other reading is retained by Littre, the latest editor of Hippocrates, t. vii   176.
2 Petit was the first to remark, that the common reading,  , is inadmissible.
, t. iii. pp. 83 — 85, Syd. Soc. Edit.
 i have ventured to transpose the negative,  , from the second clause of this sentence to the first; the sense absolutely requiring it.
 On this form of circumlocution, see below. Morb. Diuturn. Curat. ii 
.
 of the Romans was a variety of the spelt. See Appendix to the Edinburgh Lexicon.
 i have ventured to read   instead of  , on the suggestion of Petit; and to add   on my own authority — supported, indeed, by that of the Latin translation of Crassus.
 Ermerins boldly changes   to  , a word bearing no resemblance whatever to the one in the text. I prefer leaving matters as they are, although I must say, I have a strong wish to expunge the words   altogether, as being quite out of place. Our author seems to say, that in hæmoptysis it is a good thing to put flesh and fat on the patient. Of course,   is intended as the Ionic of  . Wigan uses   instead of  ; but I am not aware that there is any authority for this term being applied to a cicatrix in the fleshy parts.
 the common reading,  , is evidently inadmissible. Petit suggests  . Ermerins has  . 
2 In this clause I have found it necessary to follow the conjectural emendation of Petit, which is adopted also by Ermerins, whose annotations on this passage are highly important. The language would appear to be imitated from the Hippocratic treatise De Morbis, iii. 6.
3 This is evidently the true reading, and not  .
 In this place I have deleted these two words,   instead of the former clause,  , as is done by Ermerins. One thing seems clear — that both cannot stand, since they are synonymous.
 iliad   696.
  here refers to the stomach. Indeed, I felt inclined to change the text to  . I do not approve of Ermerins' alteration to  .
 I have adopted this reading from Petit and Ermerins, instead of  .
 the common reading in all the mss. is  , which was most felicitously amended as above by Wigan.
 i here adopt the ingenious conjecture of Ermerins, in place of the common reading,  .
 this reading, instead of the common one,  , was first suggested by Petit.
 The common reading is  , which Ermerins makes  , having adopted it from Bernard, ad Nonnum, i   52. It occurs also in Cod. Harley. But neither the one nor the other furnishes any meaning suitable to the place. To my mind, there can be no doubt that the proper reading is  , which occurs in Alexander's description of inflammation of the liver, as follows: —   (vi. 19). The meaning, then, obviously is, that in inflammations of other parts, the blood, which is the pabulum of the inflammation, has to come from another place to the part inflamed; whereas in inflammations of the liver, the blood is inflamed in the place where it is originally formed.
 the negative,  , is wanting in all the mss.; but, as Wigan remarks, it is evidently required by the sense.
 the common reading,  , has no meaning. I have adopted the conjectural emendation of Wigan, in preference to  , which is the reading of Ermerins.
 ermerins alters the last two words to  .
 the common reading is  , in all the editions, which is improved greatly by a very slight alteration, as above. I have ventured to make it on my own authority.
 the common reading,  , is obviously at fault. Wigan, on good ms. authority, reads  , which is adopted by Ermerins. Petit suggests  , which would be most suitable to the place, if it were supported by as good authority as the amendment of Wigan. It is found, indeed, in the Lexicon of Suidas; but I am not aware that it occurs elsewhere.
 this is a fortunate emendation of Ermerins for  . Compare Herodotus, iii. 40.
 The common reading,  , is evidently inadmissible. See P. ae   iii   342.
 this word is not in the text, but some such word is evidently required; and accordingly Ermerins has supplied it.
 the common reading is  .

3 Should it not be  ? See Herodot   150. Ed. Dindorf.
 this would appear to be the true reading. See Petit's Comment. and the note of Ermerins. In all the mss. it is  .
 in the mss. the reading is  . See Wigan and Ermerins; also Liddel and Scott's Lexicon.
 all the commentators are agreed that the common reading,  , cannot stand. I have followed Ermerins in adopting a conjectural emendation suggested by Petit in part.
2 It must be admitted, that the text is not in a satisfactory state; and yet I have not seen any emendation which I can think of adopting. For  , Ermerins reads  , which occurs in the margin of Henisch's edition; but I am not aware that this term is ever applied to any part of the uterus. The same objection applies to his use of   in the next sentence. Were I disposed to meddle with the text at all, I should substitute  .
 i gratefully acknowledge the benefit I have derived from many verbal emendations made by Ermerins in this chapter.
  The common reading,  , is condemned by all the editors. I have adopted the ingenious emendation of Ermerins.
 i have adopted the ingenious emendation of Ermerins in place of the common reading,  , which is evidently at fault.
2 I have ventured to introduce the preposition  , as something seems wanting in this clause of the sentence.
