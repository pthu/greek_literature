  The common reading is  , to which Ermerins adds  , which I have substituted for  , so as to produce a suitable reading with little violence to the text.

  Ermerins adopts this reading, partly on the suggestions of Petit, and partly from the margin of Henisch. It is also the reading of the Askew ms. The common reading is  . Neither the one nor the other is quite satisfactory.
  I have followed Wigan and Ermerins in interchanging the places of   and   as they stood in all the mss. I have also, like them, substituted   for  ; and have added   before  , on the authority of Ermerins. But all this patchwork still leaves the sentence in a very unsatisfactory condition.

  Ermerins has ingeniously substituted the last two words for  , a vocable of doubtful meaning.
  Wigan and Ermerins read  ; but the alteration seems to me uncalled for. I should prefer   to their reading.

 The negative seems to be required here. See Petit and Ermerins.
 This is the reading in the Askew ms., which is approved of by Ermerins. There are considerable variations in the other editions.
 ermerins suppresses  , as I think, unnecessarily.
 wigan is not satisfied with  ; and Ermerins does not hesitate to expunge these words, as being a gloss on the text. Instead of doing this, I should rather be disposed to read,  .
 The common reading is  . Ermerins reads  , a very equivocal emendation. My conjectural reading, I feel confident, will be admitted to be the true one by any impartial critic.
  The reading in all the mss. is,   — words which evidently have no meaning. Ermerins accordingly erases them, with the three following —   — altogether. This, I think, will generally be admitted to be too bold a procedure. The emendation suggested by Fabricius and Mattaire, and adopted by Wigan (namely,  , is so plausible, and requires so little change of the characters, that I should have had no hesitation in adopting it, provided there were any authority for it; but this, I fear, is not the case. I have therefore ventured to substitute   in place of it; and I am persuaded that, upon mature consideration, it will be approved of by every competent judge. I need scarcely remark, that it is of common occurrence in the works of the medical authorities, and that it is very applicable in this place.

 were I disposed to indulge in conjectural emendation, I should certainly not hesitate in this place to read,  . I wonder the present unsatisfactory reading has escaped the animadversions of all the editors and commentators.
1 Ermerins transposes all this clause,  , to the beginning of the chapter, after  . I find difficulty in reconciling myself to this change; indeed, in either place, the meaning of these words is not clear.
 There has been much difference of opinion respecting these two words. I regard the construction as an Attic anacoluthon, of which many examples occur in our author's works, and in those of aelian and Arrian, who were about his age. Ermerins mentions that Kün was disposed to regard them as belonging to the Glossema. This, I know, was suggested to him by the late Dr. Kerr, of Aberdeen, whose correspondence with Kün I saw at the time it took place, about thirty years ago.

1 Ermerins places the words   after  , but the necessity for this change is not very clear.
 should we not read  ? See the Notes of Wigan and Ermerins, which explain the difficulties about the text without removing them.
 ermerins deserves great credit for his ingenious emendation of this passage. The common reading is   and  , from which no suitable meaning can be drawn. In the Askew ms. we read   and  . In it, by the way, the iota subscriptum is generally wanting.

 i have followed Ermerins in substituting   for  , and   for  . Still neither the reading nor the punctuation is satisfactory.
 Ermerins reads  , introduces   before   and   after  . But, after comparing the chapter of Paulus aegineta on hepatic diseases (iii. 46), I resolved not to alter the text.

5 Ermerins reads  . But the common reading is quite in accordance with the usage of our author, and is retained by Ermerins himself in chap   of this book, near the end. It is, in short, an Attic anacoluthon, very common in the works of that age, such as those of aelian and Arrian.
 the common reading is  , which can scarcely admit of any interpretation. See Petit, Wigan and Ermerins.
 This word is supplied by Ermerins on his own conjecture. Certainly some such term seems to be wanting in this place.
3 Ermerins reads  , which, no doubt, makes very good sense; but the common reading appears quite satisfactory. It is but justice to Ermerins to add, that he improves the next clause of the sentence very much by a change in the punctuation.
.
 Of these translations that of Ermerins approaches nearest to the true import of the passage. The other two have no distinct meaning.
 the text in all the mss. is evidently vitiated. I have adopted the emendations partly of Wigan and partly of Ermerins. The reforms of the latter are sometimes too radical for my conservative judgment.
 In all the mss. the common reading is  , from which no suitable meaning can be elicited. Ermerins introduces many changes; thus he reads, —  ; and, in the next clause he erases  . By merely changing   into  , I am persuaded that a legitimate reading is obtained.   is a Hippocratic term. Art. 807, ed. Föes. It is to be borne in mind that the   of the ancients was a Phlegmon rather than an inflammation; i.e. it was  . See Föes, 
  Ermerins judiciously adopts the suggestion of Wigan, and substistutes   for  , the common reading.
 As suggested by Wigan and Ermerins, there appears evidently to be a lacuna in the text here. None, however, occurs in any of our British mss.
 This is, undoubtedly, the true reading, and not  , which has no suitable meaning. See Wigan and Ermerins.
