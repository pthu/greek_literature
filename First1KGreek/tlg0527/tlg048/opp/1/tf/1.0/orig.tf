Not

The

sometimes 
represented 
by

as 
in 
Zephaniah;

in 
Amaziah, 
of

tradition 
makes 
this 
Amoz

but 
on 
no 
ascertainable

(The

ἐγέννησα] 
Scholz 
considers 
that 
the 
Lxx. 
probably 
read 
a 
verb 
from 
root 
ἢν 
instead 
of 
so 
Bp 
Lowth; 
but 
the 
Creek 
is 
a 
fairly 
good 
rendering, 
cf. 
ἐξέθρεψα, 
xxiii. 4, 
Ezek. 
xxxi. 4, 
though 
it 
does 
not 
correspond 
elsewhere 
to 
Cf. 
Jerem.

σπέρμα 
πονηρὸν] 
The 
phrase 
recurs 
in 
Heb. 
and 
Gr., 
xiv. 20 
(not 
elsewhere).
ἐγκατελείπετε, 
read 
by 
AQ, 
is 
probably 
intended 
for 
the 
aorist 
(itacism).
LXX. 
omits 
‘they 
are 
gone 
away 
backward’: 
some 
cursives, 
mainly 
Lucianic 
and 
Q 
mg, 
supply 
the 
words 
from 
Aquila'
s 
version.
‘Every 
head, 
every 
heart’: 
so 
the 
Greek, 
and 
Vulg. 
caput, 
omne 
cor.’ 
The 
Heb. 
has 
no 
article, 
and 
opinions 
vary 
between 
‘every’ 
and 
‘the 
whole,’ 
which 
Ewald, 
Lowth, 
Kay, 
Skinner, 
c. 
with 
A.
V. 
(and 
R.

text). 
Cheyne 
compares 
with 
the 
verse 
Jerem. 
xvii. 9, 
Gen. 
viii. 21. 
εἰς

πόνον 
corresponds 
to 
Heb.
Kay 
construed 
the 
ﬁrst 
part 
of 
the 
verse, 
‘Wherefore 
will 
ye 
be 
still 
smitten, 
that 
ye 
revolt 
yet 
more?’ 
which 
is 
not 
far 
from 
the 
mac. 
rendering.
The 
construction 
is 
broken; 
the 
negatives 
appear 
to 
be 
cumulative: 
‘from 
feet 
to 
head, 
neither 
(to) 
wound, 
nor 
scar, 
nor 
inflamed 
hurt, 
is 
there 
any 
means 
to

of 
the 
cursive 
MSS. 
(but 
not 26 49 106 144 301 ; 48

an 
asterisk) 
supply 
the 
words 
οὐκ 
ἔστιν 
ἐν 
αὐτῷ 
ὁλοκληρία 
from 
Aquila, 
agreeing 
with 
the 
Hebrew; 
this 
however 
makes 
οὔτε

τραῦμα, 
μώλωψ, 
and 
πληγὴ 
no 
easier. 
For 
ὁλοκληρία, 
cf. 
Acts 
iii. 16. 
The 
word 
does 
not 
occur 
again 
in 
the 
LXX.,

the 
adjective

is 
found,

by 
ἐνωτίζου, 
ver. 
νόμος 
in 
the 
Lxx. 
regularly 
represents 
Heb. 
torah, 
meaning 
‘direction’ 
or 
‘instruction,’ 
and 
applied 
to 
the 
Mosaic 
‘Law.’
The 
prophets 
constantly 
urge, 
by 
rebuke 
and 
otherwise, 
the 
importance 
of 
spiritual 
and 
practical 
religion 
above, 
and 
even 
against, 
mere 
ceremonies. 
Cf. 
xxix. 13,

esp. 
Hosea

The

in 
words, 
but 
not 
in 
syntax

divisions 
of 
clauses, 
with 
the 
Heb.
προσθήσεσθε] 
προστίθημι, 
in 
act. 
or 
mid., 
is 
used 
constantly 
in 
the  
 LXX. 
to 
represent 
the 
Heb. 
word 
for 
‘add’ 
as 
in 
the 
name 
Joseph), 
used 
almost 
as 
an 
auxiliary 
to 
express 
the 
repeating 
or 
increase 
of 
the 
verbal 
action. 
‘He 
added

‘he

differs 
from

and 
Lowth 
suggested 
that 
they 
read 
‘fast,

‘iniquity.
ἀνήσω. 
The 
meaning 
of 
the 
word 
seems 
to 
be 
to 
‘let 
go’ 
whether 
favourably, 
to 
remit, 
let 
off; 
or 
unfavourably, 
to 
abandon, 
as 
in 
v.6. 
Kay 
compares 
Rom. 
iii. 25, 
πάρεσιν 
ἀμαρτημάτων; 
see 
also 
Eph. 
vi. 9, 
and 
Heb. 
xiii. 5, 
cf. 
Deut. 
xxxi. 6, 
The 
Heb. 
however 
has, ‘1 
am 
weary 
of 
bearing] 
and 
it 
seems 
possible 
that 
the 
real 
reading 
is 
ἀνοίσω 
(read 
by 62 147), 
and 
perhaps 
so 
also 
in 
ii. 9, 
xlvi. 4; 
as 
seems 
not 
to 
be 
represented 
by 
this 
verb, 
except 
in 
the 
future. 
Cf. 
also 
Gen.

‘shall

This 
is 
nearer 
to 
the 
Hebrew, 
often 
uses 
prepositions 
of 
motion 
with 
verbs 
that 
in 
themselves 
express 
none; 
and 
sometimes 
the 
converse 
also. 
See 
Davidson, 
Heb. 
Syntax, § 101. 
The 
meaning 
of 
the 
verb 
is 
thus 
extended; 
as 
in 1 
Sam. 
xxiv. 15, 
‘judge 
me 
(and 
deliver 
me) 
out 
of 
thine 
hand.’ 
Isai. 
xxxviii. 17, 
‘thou 
hast 
loved 
my

Cf. 
the 
Greek

verb, 
the 
same 
as 
in 
Isai.

Amos 
ix. 1 
cf. 1 
Sam.

Opinions 
differ 
as 
to 
these 
verses, 
as 
to 
whether 
they 
original 
here, 
or 
in 
Micah 
iv. 1—3, 
or 
copied 
by 
both 
prophets 
from 
earlier 
source. 
Many 
authorities 
think 
them 
more 
naturally 
placed 
in 
Micah, 
as 
regards 
sequence 
of 
thought: 
“the 
passage 
ﬁts 
naturally 
into 
its 
context” 
(Sinker); 
“in 
any 
case 
they 
are 
not 
original 
in 
Isaiah” 
(Delitzsch). 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
Micah 
appears 
to 
have 
been 
a 
younger 
contemporary 
of 
Isaiah, 
and 
Mic. 
iii., 
iv. 
to 
date 
from 
the 
time 
of 
Hezekiah; 
whereas 
Isa. 
ii.—
iv. 
are 
placed 
by 
practically 
authorities 
not 
later 
than 
the 
beginning 
of 
Ahaz’ 
reign. 
The 
that 
both 
prophets 
borrowed 
from 
an 
earlier 
source 
is 
adopted 
by 
many 
critics 
as 
a 
way 
out 
of 
the 
dilemma; 
or 
else 
that 
the 
passage 
“was 
assigned 
by 
some 
collectors 
to 
Isaiah 
and 
by 
others 
to 
Micah” 
(Prof. 
A. 
B. 
Davidson, 
in 
the 
Temple 
ample 
Bible). 
Other 
passages 
are 
found, 
common 
to 
two 
prophets; 
in 
which 
case 
decision 
is 
difficult, 
but 
there 
is 
a 
tendency, 
if 
one 
prophet 
uses 
the 
words 
as 
a 
sort 
of 
startingpoint, 
to 
suppose 
them 
original 
in 
the 
other; 
see, 
for 
instance, 
Joel 
iii. 16 
and 
Amos 
i. 2. 
But 
the 
adapter 
of 
the 
words 
would 
be 
likely 
to 
take 
some 
care 
in 
placing 
them; 
as 
Micah 
may 
have 
done, 
see 
Prof. 
Cheyne, 
ad 
loan; 
and 
many 
commentators, 
later 
as 
well 
as 
earlier, 
think 
they 
detect 
likeness 
to 
the 
style 
of 
Isaiah 
here. 
Isaiah'
s 
transitions, 
moreover, 
are 
frequently 
and 
markedly 
abrupt. 
On 
the 
whole, 
his 
claim 
to 
the 
original 
authorship 
has 
scarcely 
been 
disproved.

properly 
it

seem, 
to 
clap

strike 
them 
together ; 
as 
Job

Here 
interpreted 
of 
trading,

of

‘make

‘make

This

in 
the 
Heb. 
of 
this 
verse, 
but 
would 
be 
easily 
supplied 
from 
ver. 19, 21. 
The 
recurring 
refrain 
is 
a 
feature, 
apparently, 
of 
Isaiah'
s 
earlier 
style, 
as 
in 
chaps. 
v., 
ix. 
7—x. 4 : 
possibly 
due 
to 
the

E 
(often 
without

as 
Gen. 
xxiv. 29) = 
‘the

rather 
than 
as 
LXX., 
Vulg.,

This 
case 
with 5

however, 
often 
equivalent 
to 
a

R.

‘all

The

the

reiterates

(Vol. 1.

πλοῖον

Probably 
interpreting 
Heb. 
‘ships 
of 
Tarshish’ 
as 
seagoing 
ships, 
in 
contrast 
to 
rivervessels, 
such 
as 
in

Cf. 
the

Book 
rendering

Ps. 
xlviii. 7 
Θέαν

πλοίων 
seems 
here 
to 
be 
a 
mistaken 
addition; 
the 
rest 
is 
not 
far 
from 
the 
Heb., 
‘images,’ 
or 
‘objects 
of 
desire’: 
to 
the 
root 
E 
is 
by 
many 
assigned 
the 
meaning 
‘to 
see,’ 
so 
that 
θέα 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
‘an 
object 
of 
sight’ 
is 
very 
near, 
and 
κάλλος 
represents 
E 
also 
in

construe

‘the

κατακρύψουσιν] 
Rendered 
as 
plural 
in 
LXX., 
as 
if 
they 
read 
ﬁnal 4 
and 
by 
Vulg. 
contermtur, 
perhaps 
by 
grammatical 
necessity; 
it 
is 
more 
probably 
intransitive.
(Scholz 
suggests 
that 
LXX. 
read 
qbp 
for 
E).
εἰσενέγκαντος] 
Lxx. 
substitutes 
participle, 
causal, 
for 
‘and 
they 
shall 
go.’ 
Cf. 
i. 23, 
προσέχοντες, 
for 
the 
same 
Heb. 
verb. 
The 
Greek 
brings 
us 
back 
to 
the 
refrain 
with 
a 
touch 
of 
artifice.
τοῖς 
ματαίοις] 
The 
Heb. 
word 
is 
believed 
to 
mean 
‘moles’ 
(diggers), 
but 
was 
divided 
in 
most 
Mss., 
owing, 
probably, 
to 
its 
somewhat 
unusual 
form. 
The 
Greek 
may 
be 
a 
mere 
guess: 
if 
E 
were 
interpreted 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
‘shame,’ 
it 
might 
be 
thus 
rendered, 
like 
E 
or 
it 
might 
(less 
probably) 
have 
been 
read 
as 
some 
unusual 
form 
from 
E ; 
or 
μάταιος 
might 
have 
been 
taken 
as 
connected 
in 
meaning 
with 
ματεύω, 
and 
won 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
‘search.’
The 
Lxx. 
omits 
this 
verse 
altogether; 
and 
probably 
on 
this 
ground 
in 
the 
ﬁrst 
place, 
its 
genuineness 
has 
been 
suspected 
by 
some. 
It 
is 
inserted 
(from 
Aquila) 
by 
Q 
mg, 
and 
by 
the 
Lucianic 
cursives, 
and 
a 
few 
others: 
in 22

Heb. 
is 
literally 
‘high’

’exalted

occurs 
again 
ix. 15, 
where 
Lxx. 
have 
taken

as 
active,

θαυμάζοντας, 
in 
the 
sense 
‘accepters

which 
the

in

commonly 
bears 
(Levit. 
xix. 15,

The

in 
ver. 9 
(cf. 
Deut. 
i. 17, 
&amp;
c.) 
different, 
but 
seems 
sometimes 
to 
convey 
very 
similar 
force. 
Its 
original 
meaning 
is 
probably 
to 
look, 
regard, 
observe: 
cf. 
Matt. 
xxii. 16, 
οὐ

very

right, 
though 
some 
explain 
it, 
like 
the 
following 
phrase, 
of

Hexenmeister,

The 
judgment

συνετὸν

is 
used 
in 
plur., 
ver. 20, 
of 
charms

amulets; 
in 
xxvi. 16, 
of 
whispered 
prayer. 
The 
Greek 
is 
not 
easy 
to 
understand 
perhaps 
it 
transfers 
the 
idea 
to 
the 
listening 
for 
the 
sounds 
of 
mystic 
charms; 
or 
to 
secret 
initiation 
into 
mysteries: 
ἀκροᾶσθαι

the

Jotham) 
was 
followed 
by 
a 
repetition 
of 
Rehoboamlike 
folly. 
Cf. 
Eccles. 
x. 16. 
Many 
of 
the 
kings 
of

throne 
early, 
Manasseh 
at 
twelve, 
Ahaz 
at 
twenty (?) 
Josiah 
at 
eight, 
Jehoiachin 
at 
eighteen. 
Ahaz 
seems 
to 
have 
been 
wayward 
(Isai. 
vii. 12, 13), 
and, 
Nerolike, 
concerned 
with 
artistic 
fripperies (2 
Kings 
xvi. 10—12), 
instead 
of 
weightier 
matters, 
and 
despite 
of 
religion.
ἐμπαῖκται] 
The 
Heb. 
word 
is 
difficult; 
it 
recurs 
only 
in 
lxvi. 4  
 where 
Lxx. 
has 
ἐμπαίγματα. 
The 
meaning 
seems 
to 
be 
properly 
abstract : 
‘childishnesses,’ 
‘petulances.’ 
The 
Heb. 
word 
for 
‘children’ 
in 
ver. 12 
is 
akin ; 
but 
Lxx. 
there 
differs 
(see

this

but 
it 
is 
more 
probably 
the 
‘look’ 
of 
the 
face, 
as 
revealed 
to 
any 
observer: 
the 
LXX. 
interprets 
well, 
though 
it 
is 
almost 
more 
shamelessness 
than 
shame 
that 
is 
implied. 
The 
genitive 
Σοδόμων 
gives 
a 
special 
force, 
which 
is 
hardly 
warranted 
by 
the 
Hebrew.
ἀντέστη] 
Doubtless 
implies 
coming 
forward

cf.

The

means 
‘answer’: 
Vulg. 
has

in 
both 
passages, 
and 
in 
Hos. 
v. 5: 
but 
in 
Hos. 
vii. 10 
takes 
it 
from 
a 
different 
root, 
and 
renders

LXX. 
more 
consistently, 
if 
wrongly, 
ταπεινωθήσεται 
in 
both 
passages 
of 
Hosea.
εἰπόντες 
Δήσωμεν] 
Lxx. 
seem 
to 
have 
read 
the 
Heb. 
word 
for 
‘Say 
ye’ 
as 
‘Let 
us 
bind,’ 
with 
rootletters 
for 
 εἰπόντες, 
as 
in 
ver. 6, 
xxii. 13 
RAQ 
al., 
lviii. 3, 
or 
reading 
Heb. 
word 
twice, 
with 
differences. 
The 
MSS. 
of 
the 
LXX. 
agree 
in 
reading 
δήσωμεν 
δήσομεν 
Ζ): 
so 
Jerome 
on 
this 
passage 
gives 
alligemus, 
and 
Barnabas, 
Ep. 
vi. 7, 
supports 
it. 
But 
Clement 
of 
Alexandria, 
Strom. 
v. 14, 
and 
Hegesippus, 
quoted 
in 
Eusebius, 
Hist. 
Eccl. 11. 
xxiii. 15 
have 
presuably 
presumably 
rendering 
from 
root 
Justin 
Tryph. 17, 133, 
has 
δήσωμεν, 
but 
in 136, 137 
he 
has 
ἄρωμεν 
twice, 
and 
moreover 
says 
that 
δήσωμεν 
is 
the 
Jewish 
reading. 
Tertullian 
also, 
Adv. 
Mare. 
iii. 22, 
has 
Venite, 
’nquz’
unt, 
auferamus 
iustum 
quid 
inutilis

There 
is 
a 
certain 
neatness 
about 
the 
Greek; 
and 
the 
alternative 
reading 
supports 
the 
syntax 
and 
the 
D: 
but 
the 
Hebrew 
has 
the 
parallelism 
in 
its 
favour, 
and 
the 
Creek 
is 
perhaps 
inconsistent 
with 
καθ’ 
ἑαυτῶν.
δύσχρηστος] 
seems 
to 
have 
more 
force 
than 
the 
inutilis 
of 
Tertullian, 
which 
would 
be 
merely 
ἄχρηστος, 
as 
in 
Hosea 
viii. 8 ; 
compare 
also 
Wisd. 
xiii. 10 
and 12 
and 
ii. 11 
with 
ii. 12. 
It 
is 
an 
unusually 
pointed 
phrase 
for 
the 1.101., 
implying 
‘his 
goodness 
is 
no 
good, 
is 
ill 
to 
us’; 
appearing 
to 
adapt 
the 
Hebrew 
of 
this 
passage, 
‘(it 
is) 
good,’ 
with 
some 
skill.

however 
against

There 
are 
two 
similar 
roots 
in

‘be

‘illtreat.’ 
The 
former 
is 
preferable 
here, 
the

from 
the 
latter. 
καλαμῶνται, 
‘glean,’ 
almost 
in

English
ἀπαιτοῦντες] 
Heb. 
‘women.’ 
One 
discrepancy 
in 
the 
mm. 
is 
often 
followed 
by 
more, 
a 
wrong 
idea 
of 
the 
context 
perhaps 
influencing 
the 
translator. 
Here 
it 
looks 
as 
if 
‘and 
women,’ 
had 
been 
with 
‘oppressors’ 
just 
above, 
the 
parallel 
‘children’ 
having 
been 
lost.

the 
Heb. 
meaning 
either 
‘guide,’ 
‘lead,’ 
or 
‘call 
happy,’ 
Gen.

The 
former 
is 
probably 
right, 
and 
generally 
adopted.

perhaps,

easy

Juvenal

on 
this

It 
is 
not 
surprising 
if 
some 
of 
the 
Hebrew 
terms 
are 
obscure 
and 
the 
correspondence 
of 
the 
Greek 
inexact; 
actually, 
the 
Heb. 
list 
contains 21 
and 
the 
Greek 23 
articles. 
It 
is 
scarcely 
necessary 
to 
examine 
all 
these.

It 
stands 
for 
another 
Heb. 
word, 
Genesis

of 
similar 
meaning. 
Vulgate 
generally 
varies 
between

as 
here; 
omitting 
the 
epithet,

τὸ

ἐφ’ 
ἡμᾶς] 
The 
Heb. 
phrase 
is 
literally  
 rendered, 
as 
frequently 
in 
the 
Bible. 
It 
implies 
honourable 
protection. 
Dr 
Kay 
remarks 
that, 
except 
in 2 
Sam. 
xii. 28, 
it 
is 
always 
used 
of 
God'
s 
Name. 
See 
ch. 
lxiii. 19: 
Deut. 
xxviii. 10,

Num.

Chron.

Jer. 
vii. 10, 11, 14, 30, 
xiv. 
Dan. 
ix. 18, 19; 
ἐπὶ 
is 
used, 
apparently, 
with 
acc. 
gen. 
or 
dat. 
the 
dat. 
alone, 
Deut. 
l.
c.; 
cf. 
lsai. 
lxv. 15, 
where 
Heb. 
has 5 
instead 
of 
the 
usual 
ἓν. 
In 
the 
later 
writings, 
the 
phrase 
is 
often 
in 
a 
relative 
clause, 
having 
the 
air 
of 
an 
accepted 
commonplace.
Nearly 
every 
commentator, 
from 
Calvin 
onwards, 
quotes 
Lucan, 
Pizars. 
II. 342, 
“Da 
tantum 
nomen 
inane
Conubii: 
liceat 
tumulo 
scripsisse, 
Catonis
Marcia.’
After 
the 
threats, 
comes 
a 
promise 
of 
blessing, 
with 
sudden 
transition, 
δὲ 
being 
inserted 
by 
the 
Lxx. 
Both 
the 
evil 
and 
the 
good 
beyond 
it 
are 
unexpected, 
and 
in 
the 
main 
unheeded 
by 
the 
hearers.
λάμψει 
ὅ 
θεὸς] 
Heb. 
‘the 
sprout 
of 
the 
LORD 
shall 
be....’ 
apparently 
takes 
the 
Greek 
as 
representing 
a 
verbal 
form 
from 
the 
same 
root 
used 
for 
a 
‘branch’ 
in 
Jer. 
xxiii. 5, 
xxxiii. 15, 
Zech. 
iii. 8, 
vi. 12, 
but 
not 
in 
lsai. 
xi. 
I. 
But 
surely 
the 
Lxx. 
read 
the 
rendered 
by 
ἔλαμψαν 
in 
Lam. 
iv. 
ἐν 
βουλῇ] 
This 
seems 
to 
be 
‘beauty,’ 
‘ornament,’ 
read 
interpreted 
as 
the 
Aramaic 
‘purpose,’ 
Daniel 
vi. 
ἐπὶ 
τῆς 
γῆς] 
LXX. 
apparently 
omits 
‘the 
fruit.’ 
Probably 
they 
read 
 as 
preceded 
by 
a 
preposition, 
‘on 
the 
face 
οf...,’ 
perhaps, 
preferring 
to 
omit 
προσώπου. 
The 
syntax 
of 
the 
verse 
had 
become 
disarranged 
in 
their 
attempt, 
and 
‘for 
pride 
and 
for 
beauty 
were 
now 
taken 
as 
infinitives.
γραφέντες 
εἰς 
ζωὴν] 
Vulg. 
in 
vita. 
The 
Heb. 
word 
is 
a 
plural, 
which 
many 
commentators 
agree 
in 
taking 
as 
equivalent 
to 
an 
abstract 
substantive; 
Delitzsch 
compares 
Dan. 
xii. 2. 
The 
idea 
is 
frequent 
in 
both 
O.
T. 
and 
N.
T.; 
see 
Exod. 
xxxii. 32,

Not 
the

which 
so 
often 
gives 
rise 
to 
a 
doubt

the

whether 
it 
means 
‘if,’ 
‘when,’ 
‘for,’ 
or 
‘that’; 
more 
usually 
‘if,’ 
or 
‘when’: 
Vulg.

this 
verse 
with

found 
in 
all 
MSS.

The

some

The

it 
stands; 
for 
if 
πᾶς 
τόπος 
is 
the 
subject 
to 
ἔσται 
the 
clause 
appears 
unmeaning, 
and 
we 
should 
expect 
πάντα

object 
to

ἔσται

merely

e. 
come 
to 
pass, 
as 
for 
instance 
in 
vii. 18, 21, 23. 
But 
σκιάσει 
is 
an 
addition 
of 
the 
LXX., 
and 
the 
sentence 
would 
be 
better 
without 
it, 
περικύκλῳ 
being 
then 
nominative. 
As 
the 
text 
stands, 
however, 
πᾶς 
τόπος 
is 
probably 
a 
cams 
pendent, 
ﬁlling 
the 
place 
of 
another 
object 
to 
σκιάσει, 
and 
perhaps 
changed 
to 
the 
nom. 
by 
the 
influence 
of 
ἔσται 
preceding, 
aided 
by 
the 
general

τὰ

Either 
a 
paraphrase 
of 
Heb.

possibly 
a

some 
form

LXX., 
against 
Heb. 
accents, 
connects 
the 
smoke 
with 
the 
ﬁre, 
and 
some 
authorities 
take 
the 
Heb. 
so. 
For 
the 
mention 
of 
smoke, 
cf. 
Exod. 
xix. 18, 
Psalm 
xxviii. 8; 
Kay 
compares 
Song 
of 
Sol. 
iii. 6

notices 
the 
absence 
of 
any 
mention 
of 
smoke 
in 
Exod.

a

Further 
denunciations 
are 
introduced 
by 
the 
Parable 
of 
the 
Vineyard. 
The 
theme 
of 
the 
arraignment 
and 
warning 
is 
as 
before, 
but 
the 
treatment 
is 
rich 
and 
varied. 
At 
ver. 26 
a 
coming 
enemy 
is 
pointed 
out 
with 
new 
distinctness, 
but 
still 
not 
named.
The 
Vineyard 
and 
Vine 
furnish 
many 
similes 
and 
allusions 
in 
the 
Bible; 
see 
Kay'
s 
note 
on 
this 
chapter, 
and 
cf. 
especially 
Psalm 
lxxx. 8—16, 
and 
Song 
of 
Sol. 
viii. 11—14. 
The 
Parable 
of  
 Husbandmen, 
Matt. 
xxi., 
Mark 
xii., 
Luke 
xx., 
has 
strong 
verbal 
resemblances 
to 
this 
passage: 
the 
moral 
is 
also 
like, 
though 
here 
the 
vineyard 
is 
not 
merely 
the 
scene, 
but 
so 
to 
speak 
itself 
an 
actor. 
Notice 
especially 
Matt. 
xxi. 33, 
Mark 
xii. 1; 
the 
τί 
ποιήσει 
of 
the 
N.
T. 
parable, 
beside 
the 
τί

ἀγαπημένῳ...
ἀγαπητοῦ] 
The 
Heb. 
words 
are 
also 
different, 
akin. 
Kay 
points 
out 
their 
connection 
with 
the 
names 
David 
and 
Jedidiah (2 
Sam. 
xii. 25); 
and 
the 
frequent 
use 
of 
the 
former 
word 
in 
the 
Song 
of 
Solomon; 
not 
elsewhere.

So 
the 
Heb. 
literally, 
by 
a 
very 
usual 
metaphor 
for 
a 
hill 
or 
peak. 
Skinner 
compares 
the 
Alpine 
names, 
Matterhorn, 
Schreckhorn, 
ἃς. 
Hilltops 
and 
slopes 
seem 
specially 
favourable 
for 
vines, 
as 
the 
names 
of 
many 
celebrated 
modern 
growths 
testify.

at

to 
be 
taken 
up 
at

reason 
some 
critics 
have 
wished 
to 
place

The 
effect 
is, 
however, 
rather 
that

at 
intervals; 
the 
resemblance 
between 
the 
end

that 
of

ummistakable.

The

Trench, 
On

constantly 
points 
the 
moral; 
he 
quotes 
Shakespeare, 
Twelfth 
Night, 
Act 
ιιι. 
Sc. 
ι, 
“Words 
are 
grown 
so 
false, 
I 
am 
loath 
to 
prove 
reason 
with 
them”: 
and 
“The 
mixture 
of 
those 
things 
by 
speech 
which 
by 
nature 
are 
divided, 
is 
the 
mother 
of 
all 
error.”
“Ruskin,

’lz’
es, 
has 
striven 
for 
truth 
in 
language, 
by 
example 
as 
well 
as 
by 
precept.
So, 
our 
Lord 
upon 
earth 
warred 
against 
hypocrisy 
almost 
above 
all 
other 
sins 
(John 
iii. 19—21): 
and 
the 
New 
Testament, 
as 
the 
Old, 
ever 
purging 
language 
of 
its 
falsities, 
till 
at 
length 
we 
arrive 
at 
the 
point 
where 
the 
unjust 
and 
ﬁlthy 
are 
stamped 
ﬁnally 
as 
such 
(Rev. 
xxii. 11). 
Seeing 
the 
fatal 
consequences 
of 
such 
falseness, 
it 
is 
clearly 
one 
of 
the 
ﬁrst 
duties 
of 
every 
student

to 
combat 
it

The

is 
apparently 
assimilated 
to 
the 
following 
verb, 
which 
represents 
a 
Heb. 
imperfect; 
it 
is 
not 
the 
tense 
that 
would 
be 
expected 
in 
Greek, 
as 
the 
comparison 
is 
clearly 
a 
general 
one. 
Cf. 
lxv. 8, 
and 
see 
note 
on 
vii. 2. 
See 
also 
Vol. 
I. 
Introd. 
‘On 
Methods 
of 
Rendering,’ 
pp. 
LXX. 
slightly 
departs 
from 
Heb., 
substituting 
‘coal’ 
for 
῾tongue.
φλογὸς 
ἀνειμένης] 
The 
translator 
seems 
to 
have 
adapted 
the 
participle 
with 
some 
freedom. 
In 
xxxv. 3 
it 
clearly 
means 
‘relaxed,’ 
and 
the 
Heb. 
has 
much 
the 
same 
meaning 
here, 
‘sinketh 
down’ 
but 
applied 
to 
ﬂame, 
it 
seems 
to 
mean, 
necessarily, 
something 
like 
‘streaming’: 
cf. 
Euripid. 
Andromache 598, 
πέπλοι 
ἀνειμένοι.
χνοῦς] 
Probably 
LXX. 
read 
‘chaff,’ 
for 
‘rottenness’: 
cf. 
xvii. 13 
xxix. 5, 
&amp;
c. 
The 
MSS. 
constantly 
confuse 
χνοῦς 
and 
which 
Q* 
reads 
here, 
with 
about 
six 
cursives. 
Thus 
ΑΓ 
are 
probably 
wrong 
in 
reading 
χοῦς 
both 
in 
xvii. 13 
and 
xli. 15, 
and 
A 
in 
Hos. 
xiii. 3. 
χνοῦς 
generally 
represents 
and 
χοῦς 
(sometimes 
γῆ) 
but 
for 
the 
latter, 
in 2 
Sam. 
xxii. 43 
AB 
and 
ﬁve 
cursives 
have 
χνοῦς, 
and 
in 
Ps. 
xviii. 42, 
the 
parallel 
passage, 
RABR 
and 90 
cursives. 
In 
Isai. 
xlviii. 19 
Heb. 
has 
a 
different 
word 
altogether, 
and ℵ 
is 
probably 
wrong 
in 
reading 
χνοῦς 
there.
λόγιον] 
Heb. 
word 
is 
not 
the 
most 
usual 
one, 
though 
from 
an 
ordinary 
root. 
The 
Greek 
is 
perhaps 
intended 
to 
give 
an 
idea 
of 
formal 
solemnity: 
cf. 
xxviii. 13, 
xxx. 27 
(different 
Heb.).
παρώξυναν] 
This 
verb, 
or 
παροργίζω, 
is 
often 
used 
in 
LXX., 
where 
Heb. 
probably 
means 
rather 
‘scorn,’ 
‘despise,’ 
or 
‘forsake.’ 
A 
kindred 
word 
is 
rendered 
by 
ὀργή, 
xxviii. 3, 
and 
παροργισμὸς 
in 
the 
parallel  
 Kings 
xix. 3. 
In 
these 
places, 
and 
i. 4, 
Heb. 
has 
but 
παροξύνω 
represents 
below, 
ver. 25, 
xiv. 16, 
xxiii. 11; 
while 
is 
ἐπικράνθη 
in 
xiv. 9, 
and 
θυμωθήσεται 
xiii. 13. 
παροξύνω 
stands 
for 
lxv. 3 
xxxvii. 23, 
for 
which 
in 2 
Kings 
LXX. 
has 
ἐβλασφήμησας. 
while 
there 
is 
no 
exact 
correspondence 
of 
words, 
Lxx. 
seem 
generally 
to 
emphasize 
the 
determined 
malice 
of 
rejection. 
On 
the 
other 
hand 
οὐκ 
ἠθέλησαν 
is 
almost 
a 
meiosis 
for 
‘reject’; 
and 
so 
οὐ 
βούλομαι 
almost = 
῾refuse,᾿ 
viii. 6, 
xxx. 9, 
and 
βούλομαι, 
‘desire,’ 
i. 
ἐν 
πᾶσι] 
ἐπὶ 
is 
used 
for 
Heb. 3, 
where 
the 
refrain 
recurs.
The 
enemy, 
as 
yet 
unnamed, 
is 
probably 
the 
Assyrians

not 
Syria

Those 
who 
do 
not 
seek 
to 
limit 
the 
bearings 
of 
prophecy 
may 
see 
a 
further 
reference 
to 
the 
Babylonians, 
who 
followed 
Assyria 
as 
worldmonarchs 
and 
oppressors. 
The

have

in 
which 
case 
we 
can 
only 
render, 
‘hiss

whereas 
A'
s 
text 
and 
Heb. 
mean 
‘hiss

cf.

and 
Zech.

σημανῶ

Burkitt, 
Tyconius, 
’us,

points 
out 
that 
the 
O. 
L. 
read 
acc. 
with

Cyp. 
Testim. 1. 21 
having 
et 
adtrahet 
illos, 
and 
the 
῾Speculum᾿ 
et 
trahet 
eas. 
This 
must 
be 
due 
to 
misreading 
the 
Greek; 
another 
instance 
occurs 
in 
the 
same 
chapter 
of 
the 
Testimonia, 
and 
in 
other 
Latin 
authorities, 
viz. 
Domino = 
Κυρίῳ 
for 
Κύρῳ

Α 
omits 
πεινάσουσιν

πεινάω 
often

Heb. 
‘be 
weary’ 
in 
Isai., 
as 
XI. 30, 3(??) 
ἐκλείπει, 
Jerem. 
iv. 31). 
Also

for 
‘be

as 
in

(see

ἐλογίσθησαν] 
Seems 
best 
taken 
with 
the 
words 
that 
follow, 
though 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
join 
it 
with 
the 
preceding 
clause, 
as 
in 
the 
Heb.
ὁρμῶσιν] 
ὀργιῶσιν, 
read 
by 
B, 
is 
to 
me 
unintelligible, 
whether 
supposed 
to 
be 
a 
late 
form 
for 
ὀργῶσιν, 
or 
to 
come 
from 
ὀργίαζω 
or 
ὀργίζω, 
with 
ω 
for 
ου. 
The 
cursive 305 
paraphrases 
νυ. 2830 
and 
the 
word 
ὁρμὴ 
occurs 
in 
its 
paraphrase: 
Field 
pointed 
out 
in 
the 
Herapla 
that 
Syrohex. 
has 
here 
a 
form 
of 
the 
word 
used 
for 
‘leap’ 
in 
xxxv. 6. 
ὁρμῶσιν 
does 
not 
correspond 
to 
the 
Heb., 
but 
may 
be 
a 
guess 
of 
the 
translator. 
Had 
the 
LXX. 
originally 
written 
a 
late 
form 
such 
as 
ὤρυσαν, 
it 
would 
hardly 
have 
been 
lost, 
owing 
to 
Symm. 
and 
Theod.'
s 
rendering.

after 
ἐμβλέψονται,

words

evidently 
from 
viii. 
ἀπορίᾳ] 
Probably 
due 
either 
to 
viii. 22, 
or 
to 
the 
resemblance 
in 
letters 
to 
the 
Heb. 
ΑΒΒREV 
‘clouds’ 
or 
‘heavens 
thereof’: 
possibly 
a 
confusion 
with 
The 
rootmeaning 
of 
the 
Heb. 
seems 
to 
be 
‘drop,’ 
‘trickle,’ 
as 
in 
Deut. 
xxxii. 
I: 
the 
sense 
in 
Hos. 
x. 2 
seems 
to 
be 
‘break 
down.’ 
‘ruin,’ 
Lxx. 
κατασκάψει. 
Compare 
with 
this 
verse 
Luke 
xxi. 
VI. 
With 
this

compare 
that 
recorded 
in 
Amos

in 
some 
way 
by 
the 
prophet 
as 
the

I. 
Καὶ 
ἐγένετο. . 
.εἶδον] 
Heb. 
literally 
‘In 
the

and 
I 
saw...’ 
the 
conjunction 
apparently 
marking 
the 
principal 
verb.
ὑψηλοῦ 
καὶ 
ἐπηρμένου] 
It 
is 
a 
question 
whether 
the 
epithets 
in 
the 
Heb. 
refer 
to 
the 
throne, 
as 
Delitzsch, 
Cheyne, 
and 
others, 
or 
as 
Kay 
thinks, 
to 
the 
Lord 
Himself.
The 
end 
of 
the 
verse 
seems 
a 
rather 
weak 
paraphrase 
in 
the 
Greek: 
cf. 
ver. 3. 
The 
Heb. 
word 
‘train,’ 
represented 
by 
δόξης, 
is 
used 
Exod. 
xxviii. 33, 
&amp;
c. 
of 
the 
hem 
or 
skirt 
of 
’s
σεραφεὶν] 
So 
ℵΑ, 
σεραφεὶμ 
BQ, 
while 
at 
ver. 6 
A 
and 
B 
spell 
conversely, 
showing 
how 
little 
security 
the 
Greek 
MSS. 
give 
on 
these 
points. 
The 
Heb. 
pl. 
of 
course 
ends 
in 
-m, 
as 
a 
rule, 
the 
Aramaic 
in 
η
The 
word 
‘seraph’ 
or 
‘saraph’ 
is 
generally 
used 
of 
‘ﬁery’ 
serpents, 
Numb. 
xxi. 6, 8, 
Dent. 
viii. 15, 
Isai. 
xiv. 29, 
xx. 6: 
in 
Isaiah 
without 
a 
separate 
word 
for 
‘serpent,’ 
but 
with 
the 
epithet 
‘ﬂying’ 
attached; 
so 
here, 
‘they 
did 
ﬂy’: 
perhaps, 
as 
Delitzsch, 
Cheyne, 
of 
a 
hovering 
motion. 
The 
verb 
means 
‘to 
burn,’ 
Lev. 
iv. 12, 
x. 6, 
Josh. 
vii. 25 
Isai. 
i. 7, 
&amp;
c. 
Nowhere 
else 
are 
seraphim 
mentioned 
as 
angelic 
or 
attendants 
on 
God; 
cherubim 
and 
seraphim 
not 
being 
associated 
in 
the 
Bible. 
Here 
the 
seraphim 
have 
apparently 
some 
semblance 
of 
human 
form; 
there 
is 
no 
hint 
of 
anything 
serpentlike. 
Their 
ﬁery 
motion 
may 
be 
the 
reason 
for 
the 
name: 
cf. 
the 
‘living 
creatures’ 
in 
Ezek. 
i. 
and 
x., 
especially 
i. 13: 
Dan. 
vii. 9, 10 
Rev. 
iv. 3, 
and 
Ps. 
civ. 4, 
quoted 
Heb. 
i. 7. 
A 
connection 
has 
been 
sought 
between 
the 
seraphim 
and 
the 
ﬂashing 
lightning, 
as 
between 
the 
cherubim 
and 
the 
stormclouds: 
but 
of 
this 
the 
Bible 
shows 
no 
trace.

The 
Heb. 
verb 
here 
used 
occurs 
twice 
in 
vii. 2, 
where 
LXX. 
have 
ἐξέστη... 
σαλευθῇ.
καπνοῦ] 
See 
on 
iv. 
κατανένυγμαι] 
The 
word 
occurs 
in 
LXX., 
Gen. 
xxxiv. 7, 
‘the 
men 
were ’; 
of 
Aaron, 
Lev. 
x. 3; 
of 
Ahab, 
I 
Kings 
xxi. 27, 29 
in 
Psalms 
iv. 4, 
xxx. 12: 
in 
Leviticus 
and 
Psalms, 
the 
Heb. 
word 
is 
the 
same 
as, 
or 
akin 
to, 
that 
here 
used.
Liddell 
and 
Scott 
give 
for 
κατανύσσομαι 
νύσσω, 
‘prick’) 
the 
meanings 
(i) 
be 
sorely 
pricked, 
(ii) 
be 
stupefied, 
slumber: 
“in 
latter 
senses, 
perhaps 
corrupted 
from 
κατανυστάζω.” 
Bengel 
on 
Acts 
ii. 37 
quotes 
the 
Vulgate ’ 
sunt, 
and 
on 
Rom. 
xi. 8, 
which 
quotes 
Isai. 
xxix. 10, 
“κατάνυξις 
notat 
πάθος 
ex 
frequentissima 
punctione 
in 
stuporem 
desinens.” 
The 
Heb. 
verb 
(or 
verbs)=(
i) 
be 
silent, 
amazed, 
(ii) 
be 
ruined. 
Consequently 
the 
Heb. 
and 
Greek 
words 
approach 
one 
another 
only 
in 
the 
meanings 
of 
‘stupefaction’ 
and 
‘silence.’ 
Vulg. 
has 
(and 
here: 
which 
Prof. 
Skinner, 
on 
this 
passage, 
in 
Camb. 
Bible 
for 55110013, 
calls 
an 
impossible 
rendering; 
but 
it 
is 
hardly 
certain 
that 
this 
is 
so 
of 
the 
Greek, 
even 
if 
it 
be 
of 
the 
Hebrew; 
for 
it 
is 
quite 
possible 
that 
LXX. 
may 
have 
so 
interpreted 
the 
original; 
and 
it 
seems 
as 
easy 
a 
sense 
as 
any 
to 
assign 
to 
κατανένυγμαι. 
The 
force 
of 
the 
expression 
seems 
to 
have 
some 
similarity 
to 
Jerem. 
i. 6, 
‘I 
cannot ’: 
and 
to ’ 
reluctance, 
Exod. 
iv. 10—13; 
but 
with 
Isaiah 
it 
is 
not 
so 
much 
backwardness 
as 
overwhelming 
surprise 
and 
sense  
 of 
unworthiness. 
If 
we 
take 
the 
other 
meaning,‘
I 
am 
pricked' 
might 
possibly 
be 
for 
‘I 
am 
sore 
stricken,’ 
with 
a 
reference 
to 
the 
idea 
that 
a 
sight 
of 
God 
heralded 
death: 
see 
Judg. 
vi. 22, 
xiii. 22, 
Exod. 
xxxiii. 20, 
Deut. 
v. 24, 26, 
and 
Gen. 
xxxii. 30; 
which 
is 
the 
earliest 
mention 
for 
certain 
of 
the 
feelings, 
though 
there 
it 
seems 
already 
familiar.
λαβίδι 
ἔλαβεν] 
Heb. 
words 
also 
cognates.
Like 
Ezekiel 
(chap. 
ii., 
iii.) 
and 
St 
John 
(Revel. 
x. 8—10) 
Isaiah'
s 
experience 
shows 
that 
the 
work 
of 
an 
apostle 
or 
prophet, 
to 
whom 
the 
secrets 
of 
God 
are 
revealed—
see 
Amos 
iii. 
7—has 
a 
sweet 
and 
a 
bitter 
side. 
His 
lips 
are 
purified; 
but 
he 
will 
not 
be 
believed. 
Yet 
with 
Isaiah, 
more 
than 
any 
other, 
except 
St 
John, 
the 
exaltation 
of 
spirit 
remains 
dominant; 
we 
see 
no 
sign, 
after 
this, 
of 
his 
confidence 
failing. 
Jeremiah, 
by 
nature, 
seems 
to 
stand 
at 
the 
other 
end 
of 
the 
scale 
of 
temperament; 
near 
him, 
perhaps, 
Thomas, 
Hosea, 
Micah, 
Habakkuk.
περικαθαριεῖ] 
The 
force 
of 
the 
compound 
is 
as 
though 
the 
defilements 
peeled 
or 
sloughed 
off. 
The 
Heb. 
has 
passive 
verbs, 
or 
their 
equivalent: 
Vulg. 
auferetur. . 
.mundabitur: 
Aq. 
Symm. 
Theod. 
ἀποστήσεται. . 
.ἐξιλασθήσεται.
πρὸς 
τὸν 
λαὸν 
τοῦτον] 
Heb. 
has 
‘for 
us,’ 
ABBREV 
which 
LXX. 
perhaps 
read 
as 
‘to 
a 
nation’; 
τοῦτον 
may 
be 
due 
to 
the 
influence 
of 
ver. 9, 
cf. 
Acts 
xxviii. 26. 
With 
the 
loss 
of 
‘for 
us’ 
disappears, 
in 
the 
LXX., 
the 
only 
evidence 
that 
more 
Persons 
than 
one 
are 
spoken 
of 
in 
this 
chapter.
Ἰδού 
εἰμι

The 
Heb. 
has 
no

In

see

εἰμι 
is 
frequently 
used 
for 
‘I,’

Heb. 
has 
imperative,

the 
verbs 
are 
intensified, 
according 
to 
a 
frequent 
idiom, 
by 
repetition 
in 
the 
‘absolute’ 
infinitive. 
This 
the 
LXX. 
represents 
by 
the 
participle, 
or 
noun 
of 
kindred 
meaning. 
Opinions 
often 
differ 
as 
to 
the 
shade 
of  
 meaning 
conveyed 
by 
this 
Hebrew 
idiom;

renders 
here,

‘Hear

‘Hear

On 
the 
passage 
in 
Acts, 
Mr 
T. 
E. 
Page 
says: 
“The 
fut. 
ind. 
after 
μὴ 
represents 
the 
action 
of 
the 
verb 
as 
more 
vividly 
realized 
as 
possible 
and 
probable 
than 
is 
the 
case 
when 
the 
subj. 
follows. 
The 
change 
from 
the 
subj. 
to 
the 
ind. 
here 
is 
very 
forcible 
and 
vigorous.” 
It 
is, 
however, 
probably 
due, 
in 
the 
ﬁrst 
place, 
to 
literal 
representation 
of 
the 
Hebrew, 
here 
the 
“converted” 
perfect, 
equivalent 
to 
the 
imperfect 
or 
future. 
The 
Greek 
translator 
may, 
it 
is 
true, 
have 
felt 
καὶ 
to 
have 
some 
such 
force 
as 
is 
expressed 
in 
English 
by 
‘in 
which 
case....’ 
Cf. 
the 
use 
of 
ἵνα 
with 
past 
indic. 
in 
Greek; 
though 
it 
is 
not 
suggested 
that 
the 
parallel 
is 
exact:

LXX.'
s 
rendering 
seems 
to 
emphasize 
the 
responsibility 
of 
the 
people 
for 
their 
own 
blindness

“like 
the

Ps.

Ἔως

Hardly 
classical 
Greek,

renders 
the 
Hebrew 
literally. 
Cf. 
Luke

We 
have, 
however,

παρὰ

Were 
we 
dealing

this 
might 
be 
explained, 
‘up 
to 
the

‘till

See 
Liddell

As, 
however, 
the 
Hebrew 
has 
D, 
of 
origin 
or 
cause, 
it 
must 
be 
explained 
as 
‘because

Cf.

in 
ver.

The 
verb 
‘be

for 
Heb. 
‘be 
desolated’ 
suggests 
that 
LXX. 
read ‘

Shearjashub,

for 
Note, 
with

to 
A.

that 
Heb. 
words 
for 
‘desolate’ 
and 
‘desolation’ 
differ.
oi. 
καταλειφθέντες

Heb. 
is 
rendered 
by 
Kay 
(and 
Delitzsch, 
Cheyne 
very 
similarly) 
‘the 
forsaken

from 
which 
the 
Greek 
differs 
mainly 
in 
referring 
to 
the

not 
the

For 
the

ἔσται

This

be 
called 
a 
Hebraism. 
Cf. 
εἷς 
διαρπαγήν, 
ν. 5, 
where 
the 
Heb. 
word 
is 
the 
same, 
meaning

esp. 
by 
ﬁre: 
also

Cheyne 
thinks 
that 
strictly 
the 
‘house 
of 
David’ 
ought 
to 
include 
the 
‘house 
of 
Nathan’ 
(Zech. 
xii. 12); 
but 
they 
had 
become 
very 
distant 
cousins 
of 
the 
king, 
and 
probably 
had 
ceased 
to 
be 
counted 
of 
the 
‘seed 
royal’ 
in 
’s

being 
only 
brought 
back 
into

succession 
by 
later 
vicissitudes,

in

xi. 2: 
here, 
apparently, 
of 
making 
close 
alliance, 
in 
which 
case

gives 
a 
fair 
rendering: 
or 
else,

of

A 
good 
deal 
of 
uncertainty 
remains, 
as 
the 
MSS. 
often 
vary, 
and  
 the 
grammatical 
points 
may 
depend 
on 
terminations 
of 
which 
the 
letters 
are 
few, 
and 
easily 
confused. 
In 
the 
LXX., 
Hebrew 
influence 
may 
affect 
the 
construction, 
but 
mainly 
in 
the 
tendency 
to 
use 
aor. 
and 
fut. 
indicative. 
Still, 
irregularities 
in 
the 
use 
of 
ἂν 
especially 
as 
to 
its 
omission 
with 
subj., 
are 
not 
very 
conspicuous. 
Despite 
the 
suspicion 
caused 
by 
A'
s 
irregular 
placing 
of 
ὅταν, 
it 
may 
be 
right 
to 
read 
it 
here, 
with 
Q 
θc.; 
and 
ἐὰν 
may 
be 
right 
in 
xxxi. 4. 
If 
ὅταν 
is 
here, 
an 
alternative 
would 
be 
to 
read 
ἐσαλεύθη. 
supposing 
ε 
to 
have 
dropped 
out 
between 
a 
preceding 
and 
following 
σε 
the 
syllabic 
augment 
does 
not 
seem 
to 
be 
omitted. 
(The 
reading 
ἀρθῇ 
in 
xviii. 3 
is 
not 
certain.) 
The 
argument 
that 
irregularities 
of 
grammar 
occurring 
in 
the 
MSS. 
are 
likely 
to 
be 
genuine 
is 
largely 
balanced 
by 
the 
consideration 
that 
the 
grammar 
of 
the 
earlier 
writers 
would 
probably 
have 
been 
less 
bad 
than 
that 
of 
later 
scribes.

The 
scribe 
may 
have 
been 
influenced 
by 
the 
idea 
that 
Isaiah'
s 
son 
would 
be 
too 
young 
to 
accompany 
him: 
in 
fact, 
Shearjashub 
was 
probably 
only 
a 
boy 
at 
this 
time. 
Or 
again, 
he 
may 
have 
thought 
that 
the 
child 
of 
promise, 
soon 
to 
be 
spoken 
of, 
would 
be 
probably, 
by 
analogy, 
a 
ﬁrstborn 
son 
(leaving

shortens 
the

here, 
but 
renders 
practically 
the 
same 
Heb. 
more 
fully 
in 
xxxvi. 2. 
The 
pool 
in 
question 
has 
not 
been 
certainly 
identified, 
but 
was 
probably 
on 
the 
W. 
or 
S. 
of 
the 
city; 
perhaps 
connected 
with 
Siloam 
(viii. 5, 
xxii. 
II).
The 
water 
supply 
was 
always 
a 
matter 
of 
difficulty 
when 
Jerusalem 
was 
threatened; 
not 
so 
much 
lest 
the 
city 
should 
run 
short, 
as 
that 
the 
besiegers 
might 
be 
too 
well 
supplied, 
or 
possibly 
obtain 
the 
control.

Isaiah,

never

indeed 
be 
some 
special 
sting 
in 
the

of 
allusion, 
perceived 
by

hearers

not 
by

curious

Scholz 
regards 
the 
Greek 
as 
a 
guess: 
Heb.

a 
verb

‘terrify,’ 
‘alarrn’: 
it 
is 
causal;

how 
they

an 
absurdly 
weak 
candidate. 
The

has 
been 
pointed 
out, 
is 
Aramaic 
(cf. 
Ezra

The

is 
rather 
the 
employment 
of 
two

and 
Niphal), 
of 
the 
same 
verb 
‘If 
ye 
will 
not 
endure 
(in 
faith), 
ye 
shall 
not 
endure.’ 
Cf. 2

xx. 20, 
with 
the

rendering 
there.

The 
clause, 
as 
pointed 
in 
Heb. 
text, 
reads, 
‘Ask, 
going 
deep, 
or 
mounting 
high’: 
or, 
as 
A.
V. 
marg. 
It 
tempting—
if 
necessary, 
which 
some 
think 
it 
is 
not—
to 
pointing 
from 
sh'
ealah, 
‘ask!’ 
(or, 
‘thy 
petition’) 
to 
sh'
eolah, 
Sheol.’ 
See 
Delitzsch, 
and 
Skinner, 
in 
Camb. 
Bible. 
We 
then 
get  
 a 
balanced 
sentence: 
‘Deepen 
(thy 
request) 
to 
Sheol, 
or 
raise 
(it) 
to 
the 
height.’ 
LXX. 
paraphrases 
this 
with 
some 
neatness.
Ahaz 
colours 
his 
refusal 
of 
God’
s 
offer 
with 
a 
show 
of 
obedience 
to 
the 
Law 
(Deut. 
vi. 16). 
This 
hypocrisy—
it 
can 
hardly 
be 
anything 
else—
is 
brushed 
aside. 
Possibly 
Ahaz 
thought 
by 
his 
to 
cast 
discredit 
on 
Isaiah 
and 
his 
mission; 
doubtless 
he 
wished 
to 
be 
undisturbed 
in 
his 
Assyrian 
policy. 
He 
is 
like 
King 
John 
as 
drawn 
by 
ShakeSpeare, 
weak, 
hypocritical, 
intriguing, 
false, 
and 
regardless 
of 
his 
’s 
honour. 
It 
is 
quite 
possible 
that 
he 
had 
some 
ability, 
some 
original 
promise 
and 
capacity 
for 
good; 
but 
now 
he 
makes 
his ’ 
refusal. 
The 
utmost 
is 
predicted, 
promised, 
pressingly 
offered 
him: 
but 
it 
meets 
with 
no 
response.

The

Isaiah.

Heb. 
literally, 
‘little

i.
e. 
in

which 
phrase 
means 
generally 
either 
‘less

or, 
as 
here, 
’(too) 
little 
for

ἀγῶνα

Heb. 
‘to

or 
‘vex.’

recalls 
(a)

to 
cause

to

it 
seems 
to 
mean 
the 
giving 
of 
trouble 
to 
the 
extent 
of 
a 
hard 
struggle, 
and 
almost. 
to 
suggest 
provoking 
a 
contest; 
as 
the 
English 
phrase 
goes, 
‘to 
show 
fight.
Though 
God 
will 
not 
be 
turned 
from 
His 
purposes 
of 
mercy, 
man 
can 
often 
deprive 
himself 
of 
the 
advantage 
of 
them. 
We 
can 
easily 
believe 
that 
this 
sign 
brought 
Ahaz 
little 
comfort.
ἡ 
παρθένος] 
Heb. 
has 
the 
article. 
The 
commentators 
have 
devoted 
pages 
to 
this 
verse. 
Many 
deny 
that 
the 
Heb. 
word 
necessarily 
means 
a 
virgin; 
but 
in 
practice 
it 
seems 
to 
be 
generally, 
if 
not 
always, 
used 
of 
such. 
The 
ultimate 
reference 
to 
our 
’s 
birth 
of 
the 
Virgin 
Mary 
is 
guaranteed 
by 
Matt. 
i. 23, 
if 
it 
could 
be, 
in 
any 
case, 
disregarded. 
But 
those 
who 
look 
for 
a 
nearer 
reference 
in 
’s 
own 
time 
have 
been 
sorely 
puzzled. 
They 
cannot 
ﬁnd 
the 
mother, 
virgin 
or 
not, 
nor 
identify 
the 
child 
Immanuel. 
In 
their 
vain 
efforts—
see 
Prof. 
’s 
nots—
Isaiah'
s 
own 
Hezekiah, 
and 
allegorical 
personification 
have 
all 
been 
pressed 
into 
the 
service. 
Better, 
perhaps, 
to 
allow 
that 
if 
there 
be 
(necessarily) 
an 
immediate 
reference 
to 
’s 
own 
time—
with 
regard 
to 
which 
the 
question 
of 
the 
virgin 
is 
possibly 
not— 
we 
can 
reach 
no 
certainty 
about 
it. 
And 
it 
is 
not 
well 
to 
deny 
the 
possibility 
that 
the 
sign 
was 
given 
in 
a 
deferred 
form, 
which 
would 
Comfort 
believers, 
and 
be—
to
There 
may 
well 
have 
been, 
however, 
at 
this 
time, 
one 
who, 
though 
never 
recognised 
as 
a 
person 
of 
importance, 
was 
nevertheless 
destined 
to 
be 
the 
mother 
of 
a 
child, 
the 
direct 
ancestor 
of 
the 
parent 
(or 
parents, 
as 
reputed) 
of 
the 
ﬁnal 
King 
of 
the 
House 
of 
David: 
namely, 
the 
wife, 
or 
wife 
to 
be, 
of 
the 
then 
representative 
of 
the 
family 
of 
Nathan, 
son 
of 
David, 
from 
whom 
our 
’s 
descent 
is 
traced 
in 
Luke 
iii. 
This 
family 
has 
only 
once 
marked 
attention 
drawn 
to 
it 
in 
the 
O.
T., 
viz. 
in 
Zech. 
xii. 12; 
its 
importance 
arose 
only 
with 
the 
failure 
of 
issue 
from 
Jehoiachin, 
Jerem. 
xxii. 30, 
nor 
did 
it, 
apparently, 
retain 
high 
station 
after 
Zerubbabel, 
but 
fell 
to 
humble 
circumstances. 
The 
idea 
of 
a 
reference 
to 
a 
member 
of 
it 
here 
is 
but 
a 
guess, 
and 
throws 
no 
light 
on 
the 
question 
of 
the 
παρθένος. 
It 
presents, 
however, 
no 
Special 
difficulties, 
and 
may 
perhaps 
be 
thought 
to 
provide 
a 
suitable 
contrast 
and, 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
relation 
to 
the 
‘house 
of ’ 
of ’ 
day. 
It 
is 
perhaps 
worth 
noticing 
that 
all 
the 
names 
mentioned 
in 
Zech. 
xii. 12, 13 
occur 
in 
the 
pedigree, 
Luke 
iii.1 
The 
names 
Eliezer 
and 
Salathiel, 
or 
Shealtiel, 
‘l 
have 
asked 
of 
God.’ 
may 
also, 
on 
this 
supposition, 
have 
special 
significance.

against 
the

the

of 
the

and 
the

and 
it 
is 
difficult 
to 
imagine 
it 
the 
result 
of 
any 
but 
blind 
alteration. 
The 
omission 
of 
ἢ

be 
right: 
if 
ἦ 
came 
from

or 
it 
may 
have 
followed 
on 
the

The

itself 
awkward: 
Cyp.

pracferat;

is 
not 
the

a

of 
sense 
can 
be 
made 
of 
the 
alternative 
of 
choosing 
evil 
or 
good. 
But 
if 
it 
is 
not 
a 
duplicate 
of 
ἐκλέξασθαι 
which 
has 
taken 
the 
place 
of 
the 
real 
verb 
before 
πονηρά, 
perhaps 
περιελέσθαι 
(Josh. 
xxiv. 14, 23), 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
‘to

may 
have 
been 
 the 
original 
Greek. 
We 
still 
have 
the 
difficulty 
of 
the 
different 
rendering 
of

by 
ἀπειθεῖ, 
which, 
if 
taken 
as 
an 
adjective, 
fails 
to 
give 
sense, 
and 
as 
a 
verb 
gives 
an 
unbalanced 
sentence, 
and 
is 
in 
an 
unlikely

ἀπειθεῖν 
would 
slightly 
ease 
the

the

The 
main 
question 
is 
between 
these 
two 
participles; 
the 
Heb. 
means 
‘hired,’ 
decidedly: 
though, 
by 
a 
curious 
coincidence, 
had 
it 
been 
read 
as 
from 
instead 
of 
ΑΒBREVE 
it 
would 
have 
been 
taken 
to 
mean 
‘drunken.’ 
The 
exact, 
form 
used 
is 
not 
found 
in 
the 
case 
of 
E 
but 
this 
is 
probably 
not 
conclusive; 
it 
does 
not 
occur 
elsewhere 
from 
the 
other 
verb. 
The 
reading 
of 
A 
seems 
preferable, 
as 
being 
the 
result 
of 
a 
misreading 
of 
the 
Hebrew, 
whereas 
the 
correct 
reading 
may 
have 
come 
in 
from 
Theod. 
and 
Symm. 
(Syrohex. 
margin 
with 
A, 
text 
with 
B). 
The 
converse 
misreading 
occurs 
at 
xxviii. 
I, 3, 
and 
a 
similar 
case 
of 
resemblance 
both 
in 
Gr. 
and 
Heb. 
at 
xiv. 21. 
Of 
course 
the 
correct 
rendering 
of 
B 
would 
be 
preferable, 
if 
the 
other 
could 
be 
accounted 
for 
in 
that 
case. 
It 
seems 
almost 
possible, 
indeed, 
that 
both 
readings 
may 
have 
existed 
from 
the 
ﬁrst, 
as 
alternatives; 
in 
which 
case 
τῷ 
μεγάλῳ 
may 
have 
been 
inserted 
when 
μεμισθωμένῳ 
was 
displaced, 
from 
a 
sense 
that 
something 
was 
missing: 
though 
the 
Hebrew 
has 
nothing 
answering 
to 
it.

The 
details 
are 
not 
very 
clear 
in

The 
‘arrows

are 
perhaps 
not 
of 
invaders, 
but 
of 
hunters 
in 
a 
desolate 
land. 
Kay, 
however, 
comparing 
chap. 
v. 28, 
takes 
the 
‘briers 
and ’ 
metaphorically, 
of 
the 
bristling 
array 
of 
the 
enemy. 
This 
affords 
some 
explanation 
of 
‘the 
fear,’ 
but 
it 
is 
not 
generally 
Lxx. 
rearranges 
the 
connection 
of 
the 
clauses, 
perhaps 
to 
make 
an 
easier 
sense: 
ἀροτριώμενον 
conveys 
an 
idea 
of 
more 
regular 
cultivation

Heb. 
seems 
to 
do,

These

The 
Heb.

perhaps 
be 
rendered 
‘a

meaning 
one 
made 
of 
wood 
or 
of 
metal, 
the

the 
same 
as

rightly 
rendered 
‘glasses’ 
by

as 
‘glass’ 
was 
regularly 
used 
in 
that 
sense 
in 
Elizabethan 
English:

translates 
the

taking 
the

as 
introducing 
an

The 
Heb. 
words, 
‘Hurry. 
plunderspeedspoil,´ 
are 
doubtful 
as 
to 
their 
syntactical 
the 
phrase 
being 
an 
enigma.

Scholz 
thinks 
these 
words 
intended 
to 
render 
’n; 
but 
if 
the 
meaning 
suits, 
the 
order 
is 
less 
strictly 
kept 
than 
usual. 
The 
rendering 
in 
ver. 3 
certainly 
varies 
the 
order, 
and 
introduces 
ταχέως, 
which 
has 
nothing 
else 
here 
to 
correspond.

The 
identification 
with

be 
considered 
very 
probable,

It

said 
to 
be 
a 
Macedonian 
word, 
which 
would 
account 
for 
its 
Alexandrian 
use. 
Here 
it 
seems 
to 
be 
due 
to 
the 
LXX. 
taking 
‘wings’

refer 
to 
an

‘wings’

ἀπειθοῦσιν] 
In 
this

lies 
the

Lxx.

read 
it 
as 
from 
ΑBBREVE

E 
‘turn’ 
‘rebel,’ 
instead 
of 
E 
‘instruct,’ 
‘correct’;

The 
other 
words 
are 
alike 
in 
mean-.
 ing, 
but 
this 
has 
altered 
the 
drift: 
the 
negative 
in 
rendering 
the  
 Heb. 
comes 
from 
the 
preposition 
D, 
‘from 
walking,’ 
i.
e. 
not 
to 
walk.... 
(It 
would 
be 
possible 
to 
put 
the 
stop 
after

of 
after 
Κύριος, 
and 
translate 
ἀπειθοῦσιν

‘Thus

with 
the 
strong 
hand,

we

certainly 
have 
expected 
τοῖς

IX. 
I. 
Τοῦτο 
πρᾶτον 
πίε] 
The 
Lxx. 
here 
differs 
markedly 
from 
Heb., 
which 
is 
itself 
somewhat 
obscure: 
literally, 
‘Yet 
(or, 
For) 
not 
gloom, 
for 
whom 
(fem.) 
distress: 
as 
at 
the 
time 
at 
ﬁrst 
he 
treated 
lightly 
the 
land 
of 
Zabulon 
and 
land 
of 
N 
aphtali, 
so 
(lit. 
and) 
in 
the 
time 
to 
come 
he 
treated 
heavily 
(i.
e. 
honourably) 
the 
way 
by 
the 
sea, 
&amp;
c.’ 
The 
idea 
of 
drinking 
is 
thus 
foreign 
to 
the 
original, 
as 
well 
to 
the 
context; 
and 
such 
passages 
as 
chap. 
li. 17, 22, 
Jer. 
xxv. 15 27, 28 
(xxxii. 
I, 13, 14 
in 
Lxx.), 
Ps. 
1x. 3, 
lxxv. 8, 
do 
not 
help: 
nor 
does 
Habak. 
ii. 16, 
though 
the 
same 
words 
are 
used 
in 
the 
antithesis 
of 
‘shame’ 
and 
‘honour,’ 
and 
the 
chapter 
seems 
full 
of 
Isaianic 
language. 
πίε, 
indeed—
though 
practically 
all 
documents 
support 
it, 
well 
as 
Tertullian, 
adv. 
Marc. 
Iv. 7, “ 
Hoc 
primum 
bibito 
(v.1. 
obito. 
a 
fairly 
evident 
corruption), 
facito” 
”—is 
wellnigh 
hopeless. 
It 
be 
best 
to 
compare 
the 
Greek, 
word 
by 
word, 
with 
the 
literal 
rendering 
of 
Heb.:

BQ, 
om. 
κατοικοῦντες 
ℵ*B.
The 
quotation, 
Matt. 
iv. 15, 
begins 
with 
γῆ 
Ζαβουλών, 
after 
the 
main 
difficulty. 
I 
suspect 
that 
οἱ 
λοιποί, 
though 
looking 
like 
an 
attempt 
at 
rendering 
‘(time) 
to 
come,’ 
is 
an 
addition 
of 
the 
Greek, 
and 
κατοικοῦντες 
also 
superfluous: 
οἱ 
τὴν 
παράλιον 
(κατοικοῦντες) 
and 
ὁδὸν 
θαλάσσης, 
which 
is 
given 
by 
Aq. 
Theod., 
being 
in 
fact 
duplicate 
renderings. 
Apart 
from 
this, 
we 
have 
words 
corresponding 
to 
all 
the 
Hebrew 
except 
‘he 
treated 
heavily,’ 
and 
to 
all 
the 
Greek 
except 
πίε. 
This 
Hebrew 
word, 
‘heavy,’ 
 has 
the 
secondary 
meanings 
of 
‘sullen,’ 
‘grievous,’ 
on 
the 
one 
hand, 
and 
‘grave,’ 
’honourable,’ 
on 
the 
other. 
Now 
παχὺς 
corresponds 
nearly 
to 
some 
of 
these 
meanings: 
see 
Aeschylus, 
Suplices, 618, 
πόλιν 
παχῦναι, 
Septem 
c. 
Theb. 771 
ὄλβος 
ἄγαν 
παχυνθείς; 
and 
note, 
chap. 
vi. 10, 
where 
ἐπαχύνθη 
is 
used 
of 
the 
heart, 
and 
ABBREV 
in 
a 
parallel 
clause, 
of 
the 
ears. 
(παχὺς 
and 
παχύνειν 
are 
not 
found 
in 
the 
O.
T. 
as 
rendering 
words 
from 
root 
 but 
they 
render 
 ‘bear 
a 
load,’ 
as 
Eccl. 
xii. 5 
(in 
Hithpael, 
‘become 
a 
burden’) 
παχυνθῇ 
ἡ 
ἀκρίς, 
Ps. 
cxliv. 
I4 
οἱ 
βόες 
αὐτῶν 
παχεῖς. 
And 
is 
rendered 
by 
κῦδος, 
xiv. 25, 
δόξα 
and 
τιμὴ 
(xi. 10) 
being 
familiar 
equivalents 
for 
 so 
also 
τιμὴ 
for 
E 
x. 16, 
LXX. 
being 
apparently 
strong 
on 
the 
connection 
between 
‘fatness’ 
and 
‘honour.’) 
It 
seems, 
therefore, 
as 
though 
παχὺ 
might 
reasonably 
be 
expected 
here. 
Similarly, 
ταχὺ 
is 
not 
a 
bad 
representative 
of 
the 
word 
 ‘treat 
lightly,’ 
the 
noun 
from 
which 
is 
rendered 
by 
κοῦφος, 
xviii. 2, 
xxx. 16, 
cf. 
v. 26. 
For 
the 
passage 
of 
meaning 
from 
κοῦφος 
to 
ταχὺς 
an 
analogy 
is 
suggested 
by 
Lucretius, 
IV. 183, 
“Persaepe 
levis 
res 
atque 
minutis
Corporibus 
factas 
celeris 
licet 
esse 
videre.”
If 
ταχὺ 
and 
παχὺ 
had 
both 
been 
in 
the 
original, 
their 
similarity 
might 
easily 
cause 
one 
to 
drop 
out; 
and 
πίε, 
which 
is 
scarcely 
intelligible, 
may 
be 
a 
corruption 
from 
some 
other 
arrangement 
of 
letters. 
Summing 
up 
these 
ideas, 
it 
may 
be 
suggested 
that 
the 
Greek 
text 
ran 
originally 
somewhat 
as 
follows:
καὶ 
οὐκ 
ἀπορηθήσεται 
ὁ 
ἐν 
στενοχωρίᾳ 
ὤν. 
Ὠς 
καιροῦ 
τοῦ 
τὸ 
πρῶτον 
ταχύ, 
ἔπειτα 
παχὺ 
ποιεῖ. 
Xώρα 
Ζαβουλὼν, 
κ.
τ.
λ.
Except 
ὡς 
for 
ἕως, 
the 
alteration 
from 
the 
ΜSS. 
consists 
of 
reading 
ΠΡΩΤΟΝΤΔΧΥΕΠΕΙΤΔΠΔΧΥΠΟΙΕΙ
for 
πρωτον 
πιε 
τσχγποιει.
This 
corresponds 
nearly 
word 
for 
word 
with 
the 
Heb, 
though 
not 
preserving 
much 
sense; 
and 
this 
kind 
of 
correspondence 
is 
frequent 
in 
the 
LXX. 
Χώρα 
following 
might 
be 
for 
χώραν, 
object 
to 
ποιεῖ; 
written 
as 
χωρᾶ; 
but 
the 
syntax 
must 
have 
been 
lost 
after 
that. 
St 
’s 
quotation 
is 
hardly 
conclusive, 
because 
starting 
with 
the 
words 
‘The 
land 
of 
Z.,’ 
he 
would 
naturally 
use 
the
ὁδὸν 
θαλάσσης] 
These 
words 
are 
read 
only 
by 
ℵ*ca 
AQ 24 26 90 106 144 233 239 306, 
and 
assigned 
to 
Aq. 
Theod. 
by 
Qmg. 
They 
are 
found 
in 
Matthew, 
and 
agree 
with 
Heb., 
while 
οἱ 
τὴν 
παράλιον 
κατοικοῦντες), 
as 
said 
above, 
appears 
to 
be 
a 
duplicate 
rendering. 
Were 
it 
not 
for 
the 
support 
of 
’s 
text, 
the 
evidence 
would 
on 
the 
whole 
point 
to 
οἱ 
τὴν 
παράλων 
(or 
παραλίαν) 
the 
true 
LXX., 
its 
MS. 
evidence 
including 
ℵ*B 
and 
many 
cursives, 
while 
the 
more 
literal 
rendering 
might 
have 
come 
in 
from 
Aquila 
or 
Theodotion. 
The 
evidence 
of 
a 
N.
T. 
writer 
is 
however 
almost 
conclusive, 
unless 
we 
suppose 
that 
ὁδὸν 
θαλάσσης 
came 
from 
Matthew 
into 
the 
MSS 
of 
the 
LXX.; 
as 301 
reads 
ἀνέτειλεν 
for 
λάμψει 
in 
ver. 2. 
Finally, 
it 
might 
be 
supposed 
that 
there 
were 
alternative 
versions 
current, 
both 
of 
which 
our 
Mss. 
represent 
more 
or 
less 
faithfully, 
and 
perhaps 
with 
mixture; 
Matthew 
and 
Theodotion 
having 
both 
used 
that 
containing 
ὁδὸν 
θαλάσσης.
The 
‘way 
of 
the ’ 
is 
generally 
taken 
to 
mean 
the 
western 
side 
of 
the 
Sea 
of 
Galilee: 
but 
it 
has 
also

The

no 
warrant 
from 
the

the

for 
it 
are 
mainly 
Hesychian; 
and 
it 
suggests 
intentional 
insertion, 
by 
one 
who 
thought 
Judaea 
ought 
to 
have, 
or 
must 
have 
had, 
its 
share 
in

The

always

to

There 
is 
a

whether

‘to

be

some 
twenty

almost 
the

Against 
its 
claim 
to 
stand 
as 
part 
of 
the 
true

text 
are 
the 
following 
reasons:
(a) 
It 
is 
not 
in

nor, 
e 
silentio, 
in 
other 
MSS. 
not 
named

and

an 
asterisk 
in

It 
is 
a 
duplicate 
rendering, 
in 
great 
part, 
of 
the 
text 
as 
standing 
without 
it.
(c) 
lts 
wording 
coincides 
to 
a 
great 
extent 
with 
Aq. 
Symm. 
Theod., 
though 
not 
identical 
with 
any 
one 
of 
these.
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
it 
is 
not 
a 
mere 
insertion 
from 
either 
of 
the 
later 
versions, 
due 
to 
the 
Hexapla: 
for 
it 
does 
not 
agree 
with 
any 
of 
them 
entirely, 
and 
ἐξουσιαστὴς, 
τοῦ 
μέλλοντος, 
differ 
from 
them 
all: 
and 
Clement 
of 
Alexandria 
(Paed. 
l. 24) 
quotes 
it 
in 
the 
form 
θαυμ 
συμβ. 
θεὸς 
δυναστὴς 
πατὴρ 
αἰώνιος· 
ὄρχων 
εἰρήνης, 
where 
δυναστὴς 
suggests 
remembrance 
both 
of 
ἐξουσιαστὴς 
and 
of 
the 
later ’ 
δυνατός. 
Irenaeus 
also 
(Adv. 
Haer. 
IV. 33. 
II), 
as 
preserved 
in 
the 
Latin 
version, 
has 
Admirabilis 
consiliarius 
Deus 
lortis; 
and 
θεὸς 
is 
not 
in 
Aq. 
Symm. 
Theod. 
The 
simplest 
explanation 
seems 
to 
be, 
that 
an 
alternative 
text 
of 
the 
LXX., 
of 
which 
Theodotion, 
followed 
probably 
by 
Symmachus, 
made 
use, 
has 
here 
left 
traces, 
which 
have 
been 
preserved 
side 
by 
side 
with 
the 
other, 
which 
in 
the 
present 
state 
of 
our 
evidence 
we 
must 
call 
the 
true 
Lxx. 
That 
this 
latter 
is 
inferior, 
viewed 
as 
a 
faithful 
rendering 
of 
the 
Heb., 
need 
cause 
no 
surprise, 
as 
the 
true 
mm. 
of 
Daniel 
is 
commonly 
agreed 
to 
be 
inferior 
to 
the 
version 
which 
Theodotion 
chose 
for 
his 
revision: 
naturally 
he 
would 
choose 
the 
best 
available. 
The 
relation 
to 
Aquila'
s 
version 
is, 
however, 
hardly 
clear.
Something 
similar, 
in 
the 
matter 
of 
alternatives, 
of 
which 
the 
better 
has 
not 
always 
prevailed, 
is 
described 
by 
Mr 
F. 
C. 
Burkitt, 
in 
Proceedings 
of 
tile 
Society 
of 
Bibl. 
Archaeology, 
June 1902, 
“The 
socalled 
Quinta 
of 4 
Kings”: 
where 
the 
Quinta

pretty 
closely

according 
to 
the 
’s 
light, (5) 
“as

last 
is

the

on 
the 
whole, 
the

present 
considerable 
resemblance.

perhaps 
used 
as 
a 
clearer 
explanation 
than 
κεφαλή. 
If 
αὕτη 
is 
right, 
we 
have 
here 
the 
familiar 
idiom 
by 
which 
demonstratives, 
and 
sometimes 
relatives 
also, 
agree 
with 
the 
noun 
of 
the 
predicate. 
Cf. 
xxx. 21, 2 
Kings 
vi. 19: 
and 
see 
Liddell 
and 
Scott 
on

This 
is 
frequent 
in

as

 and 
VI. 128 
“Revocare

superasque 
evadere 
ad

Hic 
labor,

 But 
the 
parallel 
clause 
in

is 
different.

The

part 
of

‘swallow’ 
is 
probably 
the 
right 
rendering.
ἄνομοι] 
Kay 
approves 
this 
rendering, 
and 
it 
is 
at 
any 
rate 
not 
far 
from 
the 
idea 
of 
Heb. 
which 
means 
‘impious’

‘profane.’

The

of

where 
Heb. 
is 
pointed 
as

and 
ἄγρωστις

a

so 
also

the 
last 
clause, 
which 
is 
difficult, 
is 
also 
loosely 
paraphrased.

The 
reading 
συνκέκαυται, 
of

preferable: 
the 
future, 
read 
by 
A 144, 
has 
no 
warrant 
from 
Heb., 
and 
is 
probably 
due 
to 
the 
neighbouring 
tenses, 
esp. 
καυθήσεται 
in 
ver. 18. 
The 
Heb. 
word, 
not 
found 
elsewhere, 
probably 
means 
‘is 
burnt 
up’: 
‘burnt 
to 
a ’ 
acc. 
to 
Delitzsch, 
i.
e. 
burnt 
black.
ἐκκλινεῖ] 
Perhaps 
a 
guess: 
Heb. 
verb 
means 
‘cut,’ 
or 
‘smite,’ 
according 
to 
Delitzsch: 
but 
has 
been 
variously 
interpreted.

X. 
The 
ﬁrst 
four 
verses 
are 
connected 
with 
the 
preceding 
chapter 
by 
the 
refrain. 
At 
ver. 5, 
the 
Assyrian 
is 
suddenly 
brought 
before 
us,  
 as 
in 
vii. 17, 
but 
now 
with 
more 
detail. 
There 
is 
strong 
resemblance 
between 
ver. 8—11 
and 
the 
historical 
account 
in 
xxxvi. 1820. 11—13, 
The 
LXX. 
has 
lost 
the 
parallelism: 
Heb. 
has 
two 
phrases, 
each 
with 
a 
root 
repeated 
in 
it: 
‘decree’ 
or 
‘inscribe ’ 
and 
‘write ’: 
Lxx. 
repeats 
the 
one 
root 
three 
times, 
with 
the 
appearance 
of 
a 
familiar 
Hebraism, 
not 
used 
here, 
in

The 
Heb. 
is 
difficult. 
Lagarde 
proposed 
to 
divide 
the 
words 
differently, 
and 
translate 
‘Beltis 
bows 
down, 
Osiris 
is 
broken ’: 
cf. 
xlvi. 1. 
But 
there 
is 
nothing 
in 
the 
context 
to 
suggest 
Egyptian 
gods. 
Cheyne 
remarks, 
“The 
Sept. 
seems 
to 
have 
had 
a 
mutilated 
Heb. 
text, 
and 
renders 
by 
guess.” 
It 
difficult 
to 
decide 
between 
ἐπαγωγὴν, 
with 
ℵA 24 26 (41) 49 106 305 
and 
ἀπαγωγήν, 
BQ 
θc.: 
perhaps 
the 
latter, 
as 
ἐπαυ. 
may 
have 
assimilated 
to 
xiv. 17. 
After 
these 
words 
RA 
and 
most 
cursives 
(and 
Syrohex.) 
add, 
with 
Heb., 
καὶ 
ὑποκάτω

Qmg 
marks 
the

with 
an

and 
it 
may 
be 
a 
Hexaplaric 
addition, 
though 
not 
assigned 
to 
any

in

The 
previous 
words, 
καὶ

We 
should 
naturally 
translate. 
‘Woe

the ’; 
and 
even 
the 
Heb., 
which 
has 
Asshur 
in 
nom., 
has 
been 
so 
taken; 
but 
the 
context, 
up 
to 
the 
end 
of 
ver. 11 
scarcely 
suits 
this 
rendering.
ὀργῆς] 
If 
this 
be 
right, 
Lxx. 
are 
simply 
paraphrasing: 
but 
B 
reads 
ἡ 
ὀργὴ, 
which 
has 
the 
more 
original 
look. 
It 
is 
probably 
an 
interpretation 
of 
‘staff’: 
cf. 
πληγήν, 
ver. 24, 
θυμός, 
ver. 26; 
and 
the 
end 
of 
the 
verse 
has 
a 
different 
division 
of 
words.

‘To 
him’ 
doubtless 
corresponds 
to 
Heb. 
‘not.’ 
a 
difference 
of 
a 
letter, 
and 
both 
pronounced 
alike: 
see 
on 
ix. 3 
but 
the 
Heb. 
text 
is 
not 
here 
in 
doubt. 
‘If’ 
and 
‘for,’ 
as 
well 
as 
‘when. 
are 
various 
renderings 
possible 
for 
Heb. 
The 
word 
for 
‘altogether 
can 
also 
mean 
‘only,’ 
hence 
μόνος. 
The 
remaining 
differences 
of 
number, 
person, 
c. 
are 
such 
as 
occur 
constantly, 
as 
between 
Heb. 
and 
Lxx.
A 
state 
of 
things 
is 
described 
in 
the 
original, 
which 
is 
best 
illustrated 
in 
modern 
history 
by 
Napoleon'
s 
marshals, 
who 
rose, 
often 
from 
the 
ranks, 
to 
become 
dukes 
and 
princes, 
and 
even 
titular 
or 
actual 
kings, 
as 
in 
the 
case 
of 
Bernadette 
and 
Murat. 
In 
ancient 
times 
Alexander'
s 
generals 
founded 
dynasties 
in 
Egypt, 
Syria, 
&amp;
c. 
was 
almost 
like 
a 
king, 
and 
had 
kings 
under 
him, 
Judg. 
v. 19; 
Benhadad 
of 
Syria 
had 
ﬁrst 
‘kings,’ 
then 
‘captains,’ 
in 
subordinate 
posts 
of 
leadership, 
I 
Kings 
xx. 1, 
Lxx. 
differs 
considerably 
from 
Heb., 
apparently 
explaining 
and 
paraphrasing: 
it 
can 
hardly 
be 
brought 
into 
any 
direct 
relation 
with 
the 
Heb. 
text. 
τὴν

be 
taken 
to 
express 
generally 
the 
translator'
s 
idea 
of 
the 
position 
of 
Carchemish 
and 
Calno, 
but 
see 
below: 
ἔλαβον 
is 
a 
natural 
insertion, 
and 
Ἀραβίαν 
may 
have 
taken 
the 
place 
of 
Arpad, 
though 
the 
r 
is 
the 
only 
common 
to 
the 
two. 
Herodotus, 
II. 141, 
speaks 
of 
Σαναχάριβον

Ἀραβίων

καὶ 
Ἀσσυρίων.
For 
οὗ 
ὁ

Cf. 
ix. 10. 
Here 
Cheyne 
thinks 
 was 
misread 
‘fort.’ 
But 
it 
looks 
like 
a 
comment, 
identifying 
Χαλαννὴ 
with 
Calneh 
of 
Gen. 
x. 10, 
and 
combining 
the 
from 
Gen. 
xi. 2. 
In 
that 
case 
it 
was 
near 
Babylon; 
“the 
later 
Ctesiphon 
on 
the 
left 
bank 
of 
the 
Tigris,” 
acc. 
to 
Delitzsch. 
Some 
authorities, 
however, 
think 
that 
this 
is 
to 
be 
identified 
with 
the 
Calneh 
of 
Amos 
vi. 2, 
and 
not 
with 
that 
of 
Genesis: 
placing 
it 
near 
Arpad. 
Carchemish, 
probably 
far 
up 
on 
the 
Euphrates, 
an 
important 
city 
of 
the 
Hittite 
power 
before 
this 
time: 
Hamath 
and 
Arpad, 
in 
N. 
Syria. 
All 
these 
were 
captured 
by 
the 
Assyrians 
between 740 
and 717 
B.
C.
It 
is 
well 
known 
that 
Stephen'
s 
speech, 
Acts 
vii. 43, 
finishes 
a 
quotation 
from 
the 
LXX. 
of 
Amos 
v. 25—27 
with 
a 
substitution 
of  
 ἐπέκεινα 
Βαβυλῶνος 
for 
ἐπέκεινα 
Δαμασκοῦ. 
It 
seems 
just 
possible 
that 
this 
passage 
of 
Isaiah 
was 
also 
in 
his 
mind. 
Anyhow, 
with 
the 
history 
of 
Judah'
s 
captivity 
also 
in 
his 
mind, 
he 
may 
well 
have 
changed 
the 
name 
intentionally, 
and 
the 
intention 
may 
have 
been 
obvious 
to 
his 
hearers.

what 
we 
should 
expect

give.

fond 
of 
this

use 
it 
sometimes 
by 
mistake: 
here 
οὕτως 
seems 
properly 
to 
belong 
to 
ver. 16, 
and 
the 
negative 
has 
disappeared 
before

read 
as

the

LXX.

looks 
as

some

also 
omits 
the

The

of

rather 
vague. 
‘Shall

Rom. 
ix. 27, 
where 
St 
Paul 
seems 
to 
compress 
the 
two 
similar 
clauses 
into 
one. 
Else 
his 
text 
is 
nearly 
with 
LXX.: 
he 
has 
γὰρ, 
omitted 
by 
B, 
but 
it 
takes 
the

and 
the 
MSS.

λόγον] 
Heb. 
has 
two 
kindred 
words, 
and 
meaning 
‘consumption,’ 
‘destruction.’ 
Scholz 
thinks 
LXX. 
read 
either 
 ‘a 
curse,' 
which 
is 
hardly 
satisfactory, 
or 
‘a 
saying.' 
which 
latter, 
due 
to 
Schleusner, 
seems 
at 
least 
preferable. 
It 
may 
be 
mere 
paraphrase, 
as 
in 
xxviii. 22. 
LXX. 
uses 
πράγματα 
to 
complete 
the 
phrase: 
συντελῶν 
and 
συντέμνων 
then 
correspond 
in 
both 
places, 
though 
interchanged 
in 
order, 
to 
‘destruction 
and 
decision': 
λόγον 
and 
πράγματα 
are 
otiose 
nouns, 
and 
‘overﬂowing’ 
is 
here 
omitted 
by 
LXX.
ἐν 
τῇ 
οἰκ. 
ὅλῃ] 
Heb. 
‘in 
the 
midst

‘land.’ 
LXX. 
here 
decides 
for 
the 
wider 
meaning: 
as, 
apparently, 
in 
chap. 
xxiv. 
‘Midst’ 
is 
omitted, 
cf. 
xix. 3, 19, 
xxiv. 13, 
Ἀσσυρίων, 
Heb. 
has 
here 
no 
conjunction, 
but 
the 
clause 
is 
to 
be 
taken 
probably 
as 
a 
relative 
or 
circumstantial 
clause: 
‘who 
smiteth,' 
or 
‘though,’ 
‘when, 
he 
smite 
thee.' 
The 
change 
of 
number 
in 
the 
Creek 
is 
most 
likely 
due 
to 
Asshur 
being 
singular 
in 
Heb., 
though 
used 
for 
the 
people, 
whether 
personified 
or 
not, 
and 
for  
 the

similar

the 
unusual 
word 
κῦδος: 
the

rendered 
in 4

It 
is 
tempting 
to 
suggest 
that

is 
a 
corruption 
of 
φόρτος, 
‘burden’: 
but 
this 
will 
not 
bring 
Heb.

into 
exact 
correspondence. 
Scholz 
gives 
the

an 
addition

in

critical 
note, 
The 
Prophecies

says,

follow

But 
neither 
of 
these 
notes 
seems 
to 
present 
the 
facts 
with 
complete 
accuracy: 
for 
if 
the 
LXX

any 
superfluous

they 
must 
have

passage: 
the 
situation 
does 
not 
suit 
the 
places 
named 
in 
Josh. 
xv. 31, 
Jerem. 
xlviii. 
παρακαλεἱτε] 
After 
Gebim 
LXX. 
departs 
from 
Heb., 
which 
has 
‘Gather 
(goods) 
for 
ﬂight. 
Yet....' 
From 
these 
letters 
we 
might 
extract 
τήτῃ, 
‘help 
ye!' 
as 
possibly 
the 
Lxx.'
s 
reading, 
παρακαλίω 
and 
παράκλησις 
being 
favourite 
words 
with 
the 
translator 
of 
Isaiah: 
see 
Vol. 
I. 
Introd. 
p. 50: 
cf. 
xxviii. 29, 
xx. 6, 
xxxviii. 19. 
It 
may 
however, 
in 
both 
places 
in 
the 
verse, 
be 
merely 
a 
guess. 
ἐν 
τῇ 
ὁδῷ 
corresponds 
to 
at 
Nob 
in 
order 
of 
words: 
it 
maybe 
a 
corruption: 
LXX. 
in 1 
Sam. 
xxi. 1, 
xxii. 9, 11, 19 
has 
σοβά, 
Νομβά, 
Νόμμα, 
Νοβάθ: 
or 
‘in 
the 
path,' 
may 
have 
been 
read 
or 
guessed 
for 
τοῦ 
μεῖναι] 
Literal, 
Heb. 
having 
inf. 
with 
‘(he 
is) 
for 
staying.
The 
suddenly 
revealed 
glimpse 
of 
the 
Assyrian'
s 
march 
ends 
abruptly: 
as 
if 
a 
cloud 
or 
a 
curtain 
shut 
out 
the 
view.
συνταράσσει 
τοὺς 
ἐνδόξους] 
Explanatory 
of 
the 
ﬁgure 
in 
the 
original, 
‘shall 
lop 
the 
bough.' 
The 
metaphor 
of 
the 
forest 
has 
been 
used, 
ver. 19, 
and 
the 
chapter 
ends 
with 
it. 
Cf. 
xxxiii. 9, 
Ezek. 
xxxi. 3; 
the 
Assgrian'
s 
own 
boast, 
xxxvii. 24, 
is 
turned 
against 
himself.
B 
gives 
the 
longest 
form 
of 
this 
verse, 
and 
A 
the 
shortest, 
among 
the 
leading 
uncials. 
The 
metaphor 
of 
the 
forest 
is 
still 
unrepresented: 
μαχαίρᾳ 
takes 
the 
place 
of 
‘iron,’ 
and 
σὺν 
τοῖς 
ὑψηλοῖς 
alters 
the 
meaning 
of 
the 
preposition.
XI. 1. 
ῥάβδος] 
The 
Heb. 
word 
ἴοι· 
this 
is 
rare, 
occurring 
only 
here 
and 
Prov. 
xiv. 3; 
so 
is 
that 
represented 
by 
the 
ﬁrst 
ῥίζης, 
found 
elsewhere 
only 
xl 24 
and 
Job 
xiv. 8. 
The 
second 
ῥίζης 
represents 
a 
different 
word, 
the 
parallelism 
being 
lost.
ἄνθος] 
Heb. 
‘branch,’ 
word 
used 
here, 
xiv. 19, 
IX. 21, 
and 
Dan. 
xi. 7: 
that 
in 
iv. 
lxi. 11 
is 
different. 
ὄνθος 
is 
used 
ofa 
twig 
or 
shoot, 
Ηom. 
Od.

πολὺ 
πρῶτος 
νέμεαι 
τέρεν’ 
ἄνθεα

γνώσεως 
καὶ 
εὐσεβείας] 
The 
‘fear 
of 
the 
Lord' 
is 
wisdom, 
Job 
xxviii. 28, 
as 
well 
as 
‘the 
whole 
of 
man,' 
or, 
‘(duty) 
of 
every 
man, 
Eccles. 
xii. 13. 
Wrong 
opinions 
are 
often 
due 
to 
faults 
of 
heart 
more 
than 
of 
head. 
So 
Aeschylus, 
Agam.

πωεῦμα] 
LXX. 
is 
vague, 
Heb. 
peculiar: 
lit. 
‘his 
scent 
.shall 
be 
in 
the 
fear 
of 
the 
Lord,' 
‘scent,’ 
being 
very 
near 
 ‘spirit,’ 
‘breath.’
δόξαν...
λαλιὰν] 
The 
Heb. 
phrases 
are 
again 
explained 
and 
shortened, 
at 
the 
cost 
of 
losing 
the 
antithesis 
of 
‘eyes,’ 
‘ears,’ 
with ' 
mouth. 
‘lips’ 
in 
the 
next 
verse. 
For 
κατὰ 
δόξαν, 
cf. 
Plat. 
Repub. 543 
C, 
μὴ 
κατὰ 
δόξαν 
ἀλλὰ 
κατ’ 
οὐσίαν 
προθυμούμενος 
ἐλέγχειν.
ταπεινοὺς] 
The 
parallelism 
is 
lost: 
but 
the 
sense 
is 
clearly 
better 
than 
ἐνδόξους, 
read 
by 
Qcorr 22 36 48 49 51 62 90 106 144 147 233 239 306. 
(Iren. 
lat., 
gloriosos.) 
This 
seems 
to 
come, 
whether 
the 
original 
reading 
or 
not, 
from 
a 
misunderstanding 
of 
the 
word 
rendered 
rightly 
enough 
by 
ἐλέγξει. 
Cf. 
Job 
xvi. 21, 
εἴη 
δέ 
ἔλεγχος 
ἀνδρὶ 
ἔναντι 
Κυίου.
γῆν] 
This 
supports 
Heb. 
text, 
which 
some 
have 
wished 
to 
emend,  
 reading 
‘terrible,’ 
‘Oppressor,’ 
for 
‘earth,’ 
by 
way 
of 
a 
parallel 
to 
‘the 
wicked' 
in 
the 
next 
clause.
The 
construction 
is 
altered 
to 
more 
regular 
Greek. 
In 
Eph. 
vi. 14 
truth 
girds 
the 
loins, 
righteousness 
is 
the 
breastplate: 
in 
Col. 
iii. 14 
ἀγάπη 
is 
σύνδεσμος 
τῆς 
τελειότητος 
whereas 
in 
PS. 
cix. 19 
cursing 
is 
to 
the 
wicked 
ὥς 
ἱμάτιον 
ὃ 
περιβάλλεται, 
καὶ 
ὡσεὶ 
ζώνη 
ἦν 
διαπαντὸς 
περιζώννυται.
εἱλιγμένος, 
though 
spelt 
with 
μμ 
by 
ℵA, 
must 
come 
from 
εἱλέω. 
Seeing 
that 
mm. 
more 
often 
drop 
than 
introduce 
a 
parallelism, 
it 
has 
been 
suggested 
that 
for 
the 
second 
they 
read 
mm; 
but 
this 
supposition 
is 
hardly 
needed.
In 
the 
reign 
of 
the 
Righteous 
King 
the 
sinless 
peace 
of 
his 
rule 
is 
ﬂected 
in 
the 
animal 
world. 
The 
resemblance 
of 
a 
famous 
passage 
of 
Virgil 
is 
marked; 
many 
have 
wished 
to 
see 
in 
it 
a 
Messianic 
reference: 
others 
think 
it 
a 
case 
of 
indirect 
borrowing: 
Ed. 
ιν. 
“Te 
duce, 
siqua 
manent, 
sceleris 
vestigia 
nostri
lrrita 
perpetua 
solvent 
formidine 
terras.
llle

Pacatumque 
reget

orbem....
Ipsae 
lacte 
domum 
referent 
distenta 
capellae
Ubera, 
nec 
magnos 
metuent 
armenta 
leones.'
Also 
Ecl. 
V. 60 
“Nec 
lupus 
insidias 
pecori, 
nec 
retia 
cervis
Ulla 
dolum 
meditantur.'
And 
we 
may 
add 
Horace, 
Epod. 
XVI. 51 
“Nec 
vespeninus 
circumgemit 
ursus 
ovile,
Neque 
intumescit 
aJta 
viperis 
humus."
παιδίον 
μικρὸν] 
Man—
the 
son 
of 
man—
will 
dominate 
not 
in 
force, 
but 
in 
innocence.
LXX. 
is 
not 
far 
from 
Heb., 
but 
rather 
colourless 
and 
vague. 
βοσκήσονται, 
added 
in 
ver. 6, 
is 
repeated 
in 
ver. 7, 
where 
it 
is 
right, 
and 
A 
has 
it 
a 
third 
time, 
where 
the 
other 
MSS. 
have 
merely 
ἕσομαι 
can 
some 
more 
appropriate 
verb 
have 
disappeared? 
B 
has 
λέων 
ὡς 
βοῦς, 
nearer 
the 
Heb.; 
καὶ 
βοῦς 
ℵAO 24 106 233 301 306 
may 
be 
alteration 
to 
suit 
the 
plural 
φάγονται.
ὅρκος 
seems 
to 
be 
the 
usual 
spelling 
in 
the 
best 
Mss. 
of 
LXX. 
and 
NT. 
(Rev. 
xiii. 2). 
ἄχυρα 
properly 
means 
chaff; 
Heb. 
is 
rather 
‘straw,’ 
“i.
e. 
the 
cut 
and 
pounded 
stalks 
of 
com" 
(Delitzsch). 
Cf. 
xxx. 
The 
verb 
of 
the 
ﬁrst 
clause, 
‘shall 
play,' 
is 
omitted 
by 
LXX 
unless 
παιδίον 
(cf. 
παίζω) 
has 
taken 
its 
place. 
The 
subject 
of 
the  
 second 
clause, 
‘weaned 
child,' 
is 
also 
missing, 
so 
that 
the 
parallel 
clauses 
are 
reduced 
to 
one 
idea. 
Some 
Lucianic 
MSS. 
supply 
ἀπογεγαλακτισμένον 
before 
ἐπὶ 
κοίτην.
Cf. 
lxv. 25. 
For 
σύμπασα, 
see 
Vol. 1. 
pp. 26, 
ὦς 
ὕδωρ 
πολὺ 
κατακαλύψαι 
Cf. 
Habak. 
ii. 14, 
where 
Heb. 
is 
somewhat 
different 
in 
construction 
and 
order. 
Here 
πολὺ 
is 
an 
addition 
of 
the 
LXX. 
Heb. 
literally 
is, 
‘as 
the 
waters 
covering 
the 
sea,' 
with 
the 
preposition 
before 
the 
object, 
and 
the 
participle 
equivalent 
to 
a 
tense 
expressing 
an 
established 
condition 
of 
things. 
κατακαλύψαι 
(V 
reads 
ψει) 
is 
probably 
optative, 
used 
in 
a 
comparative 
clause, 
as 
in 
xxi. 1, 
where 
Heb. 
has 
with 
inf. 
In 
Habakkuk 
ii. 14 
Heb. 
has 
fut., 
Lxx. 
κατακαλύψει. 
In 
Ezek. 
xxxviii. 9, 16, 
Heb. 
has 
 with 
inf.; 
and 
LXX. 
in 9 
has 
ἥξει

ὡς· 
νεφέλη 
κατακαλύψαι 
(some 
Luc. 
MSS. 
καλύψαι) 
γῆν, 
in 16 
ἀναβήσῃ...
ὡς 
νεφέλη 
καλύψω 
γῆν, 
where 49 68 87 90 91 228 233 238 
read 
καὶ 
καλύψας, 
and 62 
τοῦ 
καλύψαι 
the 
Würzburg 
fragment 
reading 
in 9 
sicut 
nubs 
operire 
terrain, 
but 
in 16 
operriet. 
In 
Ezek. 
xx. 32, 
Heb. 
with 
inf., 
LXX. 
has 
Ἐσόμεθα 
ὧς 
τὰ 
ἔθνη 
καὶ 
ὡς 
αἱ 
φυλαὶ 
τῆς 
γῆς 
τοῦ 
λατρεύειν 
ξύλοις 
καὶ 
λίθοις. 
Numb. 
xxiii. 19, 
Heb. 
has 
the 
(jussive) 
imperfect 
with (??) 
but 
LXX. 
has 
an 
unmistakable 
infin. 
in 
each 
clause, 
οὐχ 
ὡς 
ἅνθρωπος 

ὁ 
θεὸς 
διαρτηθῆναι, 
οὐδὲ 
ὡς 
υἱὸς 
ἀνθρώπου 
ἀπειληθῆναι; 
with 
which 
compare 
I 
Sam. 
xv. 29, 
Heb. 
with 
inf., 
LXX. 
τοῦ 
μετανοῆσαι 
αὐτός. 
Davidson, 
Heb. 
Syntax, § 65 
c, 
Driver, 
Heb. 
Tenses, 
ed. 1, § 64. 
These 
passages 
seem 
to 
show 
that 
the 
infin. 
with 
ὡς 
is 
possible, 
in 
a 
sense 
not 
unlike 
the 
present 
verse. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
in 
Numb. 
xxii. 4, 
Heb. 
nifin. 
with 
LXX. 
has 
ὣς 
ἐκλέξαι 
Β, 
ὡσεὶ 
ἐκλίξει 
AF, 
so 
that 
the 
balance 
seems 
against 
infin.; 
and 
also 
in 
Deut. 
xxxii. 11, 
Heb. 
imperf., 
LXX. 
ὡς 
ἀετὸς 
σκεπάσαι 
νοσσιὰν 
αὐτοῦ 
(σκεπάσει 
Ι 
R 44 74 76 106 128 134): 
while 
in 
Isai. 
xxi. 1 
the 
Optative 
is 
certainly 
read. 
On 
the 
whole, 
therefore, 
the 
infin. 
seems 
possible 
here: 
but 
the 
passages 
coming 
nearest 
in 
shade 
of 
meaning 
are 
either 
uncertain, 
or 
favour 
the 
Optative. 
In 
PS. 
lxiii. 5, 
ὡσεὶ 
στέατος 
καὶ 
πιότητος 
ἐμπλησθείη 
ἡ 
ψυχή 
μου, 
and 
xc. 6, 
the 
particle 
is 
ὡσεί, 
and 
even 
so, 
the 
Optative 
probably 
does 
not 
depend 
upon 
it, 
though 
it 
does 
so 
in 
lxxxiii. 
ἦ 
ῥίζα] 
The 
article 
gives 
the 
right 
sense: 
the 
word 
in 
Heb. 
is 
the 
same 
as 
the 
second 
one 
rendered 
by 
ῥίζης 
in 
ver. 
τιμὴ] 
Heb. 
is 
also 
a 
substantive.

δεῖξαι] 
LXX. 
supplies 
τοῦ 
δεῖξαι, 
treating

its 
usual 
auxiliary 
sense. 
So, 
practically, 
most

R.

'adjiciet

τοῖο 
ζηλῶσαι] 
Heb. 
to 
‘purchase’

‘redeem,’ 
which 
LXX. 
has 
read 
as 
from 
mp, 
or 
taken 
as 
equivalent 
to 
it, 
as 
it 
seems 
to 
be 
in 
Ezek.

not. 
conversely 
has

a 
different 
view.
Βαβνληνίας] 
Here 
the 
list 
of 
names 
begins 
to 
diverge 
from 
Heb., 
which 
here 
has 
Pathros, 
i.
e. 
Upper 
Egypt, 
Gen. 
x. 14, 
Ezek. 
xxix. 14 
Jerem. 
xliv. 1, 15. 
LXX. 
more 
often 
uses 
Βαβυλὼν 
than 
Βαβυλωνία, 
though 
see 
xiv. 23, 
xxxix. 1; 
not 
the 
parallel 
passage 
in 
Kings. 
In 
Zech. 
v. 11 
LXX. 
ἐν 
γῇ 
Βαβυλῶνος, 
Heb. 
has 
Shinar
Αἰθιοπίας] 
The 
regular 
equivalent 
for 
Heb. 
Cask.
καὶ 
ἀπὸ 
ἡλίου 
ἀναπλεῖν] 
Further 
divergence, 
Heb. 
having 
‘and 
from 
Shinar, 
and 
from 
Hamath, 
and 
from 
the 
isles 
of 
the 
sea' 
Shinar 
may 
have 
been 
omitted 
in 
consequence 
of 
Βαβυλωνίας 
above. 
Hamath 
was 
possibly 
read 
as 
man, 
a 
poetic 
word 
for 
‘sun,’ 
which 
the 
translator 
misreads 
in 
xxiv. 2 3, 
but 
translates 
rightly 
in 
xxx. 26; 
Ἀραβίας 
intrudes, 
as 
in 
x. 9, 
and 
‘the 
isles 
of 
the 
sea' 
disappears.
Delitzsch 
pointed 
out 
that 
the 
dispersion 
implied 
did 
not 
exist 
till 
after 
Isaish'
s 
time. 
The 
places 
named 
were, 
in 
his 
day, 
divided 
between 
Assyria 
and 
Egypt. 
The 
name 
‘Assyria’ 
seems 
to 
have 
survived 
to 
later 
times 
as 
meaning 
the 
great 
kingdom 
of 
W. 
Asia, 
even 
after 
the 
exile, 
Ezra 
vi. 22: 
just 
as 
Horace 
calls 
the 
Parthians 
Perm: 
and 
even 
Medan, 
0d. 111. 
viii. 19. 
But 
to 
argue 
that 
the 
mention 
of 
Assyria 
here 
points 
to 
a 
late 
date 
or 
nonIsaianic 
authorship, 
is 
curiously 
unconvincing.
πτερύγων] 
Literally 
from 
Heb. 
Cf. 
xxiv. 16, 
Ezek. 
vii. 2 
Job 
xxxvii. 3, 
xxxviii. 13. 
τὸ 
πτερύγιον 
τοῦ 
ἱεροῦ, 
Matt. 
iv. 5, 
Luke 
iv. 9 
is 
uncertain 
in 
meaning, 
but 
would 
give 
a 
good 
sense 
if 
it 
meant 
a 
corner 
or 
end 
of 
some 
part 
of 
the 
building.
ζυγὸς] 
So 
A 106, 
but 
ζῆλος 
of 
the 
other 
MSS. 
can 
hardly 
be 
wrong. 
ζυγὸς 
may 
be 
due 
to 
the 
influence 
of 
x. 
The 
woeful 
antagonism 
of 
the 
tribes, 
ix. 21, 
is 
to 
cease.
πεισθήσονται] 
This

ἂν

Apparently 
a 
paraphrase 
or 
guess: 
Heb. 
‘on

referring 
to 
the 
seaward 
slope 
of 
Philistia. 
Cf. 
Numb.

'The

‘Edom’

also 
included, 
against 
the

πρῶτον...
πρῶτοι] 
Not 
in

Perhaps 
the

remembered 
the 
early

of 
David. 
The 
glories 
of 
the 
Kingdom 
of 
the 
Twelve 
Tribes 
are 
to 
be 
renewed, 
and 
it 
is 
to 
triumph 
over 
its 
sometime 
oppressors.
ἐρημώσει] 
Apparently 
equivalent 
to 
‘shall 
dry 
up': 
Vulg. 
desolabit, 
cf. 
xliv. 27, 
l. 2. 
Thus 
it 
is 
probable 
that 
LXX. 
read 
the, 
word 
as 
causal 
of 
‘dry 
up,' 
instead 
of 
‘lay 
under 
a 
ban.

supposed 
to 
mean 
‘parching

Some 
wish

alter

‘strength.’ 
But 
the 
older 
authorities 
seem 
to 
have 
taken 
the 
text 
in 
this 
general 
sense: 
so 
Vulg.

The

more 
marked 
in

the

similar.

Jeremiah

Ezekiel

considerable 
to 
the

and 
the

Obadiah, 
Jonah,

Nahum

mainly 
concerned

Indirectly,

the

their 
hearing 
on 
Judah

of 
this

as 
of 
many 
similar 
headings 
to

Psalms. 
Those 
who 
assign 
the 
chapter 
to 
a 
writer 
of 
a 
later 
time 
than 
Isaiah 
set 
it 
aside 
as 
a 
matter

course.
Ὄρασις] 
The 
Heb. 
Massa, 
translated 
‘burden,’ 
according 
to 
its 
relation 
to 
verb 
to 
bear,' 
‘lift 
up,' 
or 
‘oracle.’ 
LXX. 
renders 
in 
Isaiah 
by 
ὅρασις, 
ὅραμα, 
or 
ῥῆμα: 
elsewhere 
generally 
by 
λῆμμα, 
according 
to 
Liddell

Scott 
ﬁrst 
the

Opposed

so 
for 
the 
poem 
or

itself. 
That 
the 
Heb.

is 
used 
in 
a 
derived 
sense, 
is 
shown, 
Kay

by 
the 
addition

Ἐπ’

Heb. 
probably 
means 
a 
'baretopped' 
or 
conspicuous 
mountain; 
the 
Greek 
most 
likely 
a 
mountain 
in 
a 
plain, 
solitary 
and 
prominent: 
though 
it 
is 
difficult 
to 
prove 
that 
it 
might 
not 
mean 
‘level,’ 
i.
e. 
ﬂattopped. 
The

of 
Luke 
vi. 17 
seems 
to 
mean 
a 
level 
space 
on 
a 
mountain 
side.
Α 
comparison 
of 
xxxii. 18, 
however, 
suggests 
that 
LXX. 
may 
have 
read 
(or 
confused 
the

with) 
nearly 
conversely 
with

τ.
λ.] 
The 
text 
here 
is 
discussed 
by 
Mr 
Burkitt, 
Tyconius, 
p. 
cxiv. 
foll. 
He 
points 
out 
that 
the 
reading 
of 
the 
Lucianic 
cursives, 
with 62 147, 
is
εγω 
συντασσω 
γηιασμενοι 
εισιν 
και 
εγω 
αγω 
αυτους 
(α)
(So 
Tycon. 
p. 50 
nearly, 
see 
below.) 
Β* 
omits 
ηγιασμενοι 
εισι 
and 
(according 
to 
Camb. 
LXX.) 
αγω 
(β)
ℵΑΒmgQ 
read
εγω 
συντασσω 
και 
εγω 
(αγω) 
αυτοθς·
ηγιασμενοι 
εισι 
και 
εγω 
αγω 
αιτους 
(β2)
A 
omits 
αγω 
the 
first 
time.
Of  
these 
he 
decides 
for 
(a) 
which 
Dr 
Field 
prints 
in 
his 1859 
edition. 
“It 
has 
equivalents,” 
he 
says, 
“though 
they 
are 
unintelligent, 
for 
each 
Hebrew 
word 
in 
its 
proper 
order.” 
αυτους 
he 
explains 
as 
due 
to 
reading 
 as 
 for 
ηγιασμενοι 
εισι 
he 
suggests 
may 
be 
due, 
somewhat 
similarly, 
to 
reading 
ηγισςμενοιω 
as 
ηγιαςμενοι; 
and 
there 
remains 
the 
difference 
that 
Tyconius 
agrees 
with 
the 
Heb. 
in 
reading 
et 
voco 
eos 
(=και 
καλω 
αυτους) 
where 
the 
Greek 
has 
καὶ 
ἐγὼ 
ἄγω 
αὐτοὺς 
(the 
cursive 301 
has 
ἐγὼ 
συντάσσω 
καὶ 
ἐγὼ 
καλῶ 
αὐτοὺς 
ἡγιασμένοι 
εἰσὶν). 
He 
thinks 
that 
B* 
omitted 
ἡγιασμ. 
εἰσὶν 
as 
awkward, 
and 
that 
β2 
is 
an 
attempt 
to 
emend 
β 
by 
α: 
unless, 
indeed 
β 
came 
by 
homoeoteleuton 
from 
β2: “ 
but 
in 
that 
case 
it 
is 
very 
difficult 
to 
explain 
how 
β2 
ever 
came 
into 
existence. 
It 
does 
not 
commend 
itself 
as 
an 
original, 
or 
as 
a 
translation, 
and 
it 
does 
not 
appear 
in 
any 
text 
earlier 
than 
the 
Hexapla.” 
Agreeing 
that 
(α) 
is 
the 
best 
reading, 
and 
the 
nearest 
to 
the 
original 
LXX., 
I 
suggest 
that 
the 
process 
of 
corruption 
was 
this: 
καὶ 
ἐγὼ 
ἄγω 
was 
originally 
καὶ 
ἐγὼ 
καλῶ 
or 
καὶ 
καλῶ: 
this 
bhecame 
καγωκαγω 
(or 
καικαγω), 
and 
then 
καὶ 
ἐγὼν 
ἄγω. 
ἡγιασμένοι 
εἰσὶ 
was 
then 
dropped 
out, 
and 
when 
it 
was 
replaced, 
καὶ 
ἐγὼ 
ἄγω 
αὐτοὺς 
was 
written 
before 
it 
as 
well 
as 
after, 
some 
confusing 
having 
arisen, 
and 
the 
corruption 
from 
καλῶ 
to  
ἄγω 
having 
induced 
scribes 
to 
couple 
it 
with 
συντάσσω.
γίγαντες

τὸν

so 
ℵAB: 106

παῦσαι 
for 
πληρῶσαι, 
and 
the 
Luc. 
MSS., 62 147 
have 
τὸν 
θυμόν

παῦσαι. 
So 
Tyconius 
p. 50 
has 
gigantes

iram

lenire 
(v.
l. 
mitigare). 
Here 
ἔρχονται 
and 
the 
following 
infin. 
have 
no 
corresponding 
Heb., 
and 
it 
may 
be 
inferred, 
that 
the 
version 
supplied 
them 
to 
give 
sense 
(or 
to 
paraphrase 
παῦσαι 
and 
πληρῶσαι 
may 
have 
been 
alternatives, 
even 
from 
the

the 
order 
of

to

near. 
Classical

The

be 
small,

‘conﬁdent’; 
the

used

οἰκ. 
ὅλῃ] 
Heb. 
has 
not 
the 
adjective, 
but 
uses 
a 
word 
here 
which 
means 
‘the 
inhabited 
world'; 
also 
in 
xiv. 17, 21, 
xviii. 3, 
xxiv. 4 
xxvi. 9, 18,

renders 
by 
οἰκουμένη, 
unless 
οἰκέω 
or 
a 
compound 
of 
it 
occurs 
in 
the 
sentence: 
except

Heb.

from 
the 
same

It 
appears 
therefore 
to 
be 
a 
favourite 
word 
with 
Isaiah, 
but 
for 
one 
which 
the 
Lxx. 
found 
no 
rendering 
in 
which 
they 
felt 
unvarying 
confidence. 
See 
also 
Ps. 
lxxxix. 7, 
ἐνδοξαζόμενος, 
Job

LXX. 
shortens 
the 
verse), 
for 
varieties 
in 
the 
meaning.
ἔσονται

Not 
in 
the 
Heb., 
either 
here 
or 
in 
ver. 14. 
Here 
it 
may 
be 
an 
attempt 
at 
paraphrase, 
if 
not 
borrowed; 
see 
xxxvii. 31. 
In 
ver. 14 
it 
certainly 
seems 
to 
be 
repeated 
from 
this 
place.
ἄπυρον] 
The 
idea 
is 
of 
native, 
not 
ﬁned 
gold. 
Cf. 
Homer, 
Iliad, 
ΙΧ 122, 
of 
'brandnew' 
vessels,

Heb. 
has, 
not 
‘stone,’ 
but 
a 
peculiar 
word 
for 
‘gold,’ 
found 
also 
Job 
xxviii. 16. 
Here 
it 
may 
be 
that 
the 
translator 
guessed 
or 
paraphrased. 
That 
LXX. 
read 
for 
(Scholz) 
seems 
rather 
a 
violent 
supposition.
Σουφείρ] 
Heb. 
Ophir, 
said 
to 
be 
Abhira, 
near 
the 
mouth 
of 
the 
Indus, 
where 
Phoenician 
ships 
traded. 
Except 
in 
Gen. 
x. 29 
(where 
Σωφήρα 
follows 
in 
ver. 30, 
Heb. 
Sephar), 
LXX. 
generally 
begin 
the

stands 
in 
the 
best 
MSS. 
for 
Asa. 
In 
Jer. 
x. 9 
Μωφάζ 
is 
due 
to 
the 
Heb. 
preposition 
being 
read 
as 
part 
of 
the 
name.

πλανώμενον] 
Added 
by 
Lxx., 
apparently 
to 
balance 
the 
clauses. 
In 
verses 13—16

is 
some 
tendency 
to

The

and 
so 
some 
Luc. 
cursives. 
Possibly

“The 
ﬂying 
Mede, 
his 
broken 
shaftless 
bow;
The 
ﬁery 
Greek, 
his 
red 
pursuing 
spear.'
These 
were 
their 
characteristic 
weapons, 
as 
the 
sword 
was 
of 
the 
Romans. 
The 
syntax 
differs 
from 
the 
Hebrew: 
τοξεύματα 
νεανίσκων 
is 
probably 
the 
object 
of 
the 
verb.

Heb.

said 
to 
mean 
'groaners.' 
Scholz 
thinks 
the 
Greek 
is 
an 
attempt 
to 
come 
near 
the 
sound 
of 
the 
Heb. 
word.

Compare 
xxxiv. 11—15. 
σειρῆνες 
may 
be 
‘owls,’ 
but 
Heb. 
is 
probably 
‘daughters 
of 
the 
ostrich.
δαιμόνια] 
Heb. 
word 
means 
‘goats’ 
(hairy 
ones): 
some 
have 
suggested 
‘baboons,’ 
others 
think 
goatshaped 
demons 
are 
meant. 
This 
mixture 
however 
of 
demons 
with 
animals 
would 
hardly 
seem 
reasonable 
in 
a 
heathen 
writer, 
for 
instance 
in 
Horace, 
0d. 111. 
iii. 36 
foll., 
or 
Epod. 
xvi.; 
how 
much 
less 
so 
in 
Isaiah!
ὀνοκένταυροι] 
Perhaps 
apes 
of 
some 
sort. 
The 
Heb., 
‘wailers,’ 
may 
mean 
wolves, 
as 
in 
R.
V.
ἐχίνοι] 
Heb. 
supposed 
to 
mean 
jackals.
The 
last 
verse 
is 
shortened 
by 
Lxx.
XIV. 1, 2. 
Delitzsch 
on 
these 
two 
verses 
says: 
“Here 
we 
have 
the 
consoling 
content 
of 
ch. 
xl.—
lxvi. 
in 
nuce.”
γαόρας] 
Apparently 
the 
Semitic 
word 
(or 
as 
in 
Heb. 
The 
later 
versions 
have 
the 
more 
usual 
προσήλυτος; 
γειώρας·

again 
only 
Exod. 
xii. 19,

in 
Exod. 
ii. 22 
as 
quoted 
by 
Philo.
προστεθήσεται] 
Not 
here 
used 
as 
an 
auxiliary, 
but 
representing 
two 
different 
Heb. 
words; 
the 
second 
of 
which, 
however, 
may 
very 
likely 
have 
been 
taken 
for 
the 
Niphal 
of

of 
καὶ 
πληθυνθήσονται] 
An 
addition 
by 
the 
LXX. 
It 
seems 
best 
to 
keep 
ἔθνη 
as 
the 
subject 
of 
the 
verbs, 
in 
which 
case 
κατακληρονομή 
σουσιν 
is 
causal, 
‘shall 
make 
them 
to

alone 
supplies 
οἶκος 
Ἰσραήλ, 
as 
in 
Heb.
τοῦ 
Θεοῦ] 
Omitted 
by 
B. 
Heb. 
has 
‘of 
the 
LORD.
θυμοῦ] 
The 
Heb. 
word 
means 
‘vexation’ 
or 
‘disquiet,’ 
but 
sometimes 
‘fury,’ 
as 
in 
Habak. 
iii. 
Θρῆνον] 
Heb. 
word 
mdslzdl 
generally 
means 
a 
parable 
or 
parallel, 
and 
hence 
sometimes 
a 
‘tauntsong.’ 
The 
poem 
which 
follows 
bears, 
by 
irony, 
the 
form 
of 
an 
elegy, 
which 
seems 
the 
justification 
of 
the 
LXX.'
s 
rendering, 
found 
here 
only; 
though 
we 
may 
compare 
such 
passages 
as 
Lam. 
ii. 15 
foll., 
Ezek. 
xxvi. 17 
foll., 
xxxii. 18 
foll., 
and 
almost 
the 
whole 
of 
xxvii. 
There 
seems 
to 
have 
been 
a 
tendency 
in 
other 
languages 
to 
employ 
the 
metres 
of 
elegy 
for 
satiric 
purposes: 
Horace'
s 
epodes, 
the 
Archilochian 
metres 
which 
he 
borrows, 
Martial'
s 
epigrams, 
the 
γνῶμαι 
of 
Theognis, 
and 
some 
of 
Propertius' 
poems, 
are 
instances, 
in 
varying 
degrees.
ὁ 
ἐπισπουδαστὴς] 
Heb. 
word 
occurs 
only 
here, 
and 
is 
obscure. 
Many, 
including 
A.
V., 
have 
taken 
it 
as 
connected 
with 
the 
Aramaic 
form 
of 
‘gold.’ 
Delitzsch 
interprets 
it 
from 
another 
root, 
as 
'place 
place 
of 
torture.' 
Lxx. 
are 
generally 
thought 
to 
have 
read 
numb, 
‘insolent 
dealings,' 
cf. 
Ralzab, 
xxx. 7, 
li. 9, 
instead 
of 
 Most 
moderns 
are 
inclined 
to 
follow 
this 
reading. 
ἐπισπουδαστὴς 
(cf. 
κατέσπευδον, 
Exod. 
v. 10, 13) 
seems 
to 
mean 
‘one 
who 
presses 
hard ’ 
another, 
Le. 
a 
hard 
taskmaster. 
Vulgate 
has 
tributum.
ζυγὸν] 
The 
parallelism 
is 
lost 
by 
this 
loose 
rendering 
of 
'staff 
and 
'rod': 
the 
latter 
word 
so 
rendered 
again, 
ver. 
ἀνιάτῳ] 
Not 
the 
same 
Heb. 
expression 
as 
in 
xiii. 9, 
though 
the 
word 
for 
'wrath,' 
close 
by, 
is 
the 
same.
παίων] 
Heb. 
rather 
‘ruling,’ 
‘subduing’: 
LXX. 
has 
thus 
for 
once 
increased 
the 
parallelism: 
but 
their 
rendering 
is 
loose, 
the 
vague 
θυμοῦ 
taking 
the 
place 
of 
‘(with) 
a 
pursuit.' 
'Restrained' 
is 
taken 
in 
another 
aspect 
as 
‘spared,’ 
cf. 
Prov. 
xiii. 24, 
and 
in 
different 
syntax. 
The 
relative 
is 
probably 
right, 
see 
R.
V.
ἀνεπαύσατο 
πεποιθὼς] 
These 
words 
belong 
in 
the 
Heb. 
to 
the 
next 
clause, 
with 
‘earth’ 
as 
the 
subject.
εὐφροσύνης] 
Heb. 
words 
for 
joyful 
singing 
are 
often 
rendered 
thus. 
See 
ver. 11, 
xvi. 10. 
xliv. 23, 
and 
liv. 
I, 
εὐφράνθητι. 
Also, 
with 
different 
Heb., 
but 
in 
close 
connection 
with 
singing 
and 
music, 
xxiv. 7 8, 
II, 
lv. 
II, 
where 
the 
Heb. 
word 
here 
used 
is 
χαρά.
Here 
the 
trees 
of 
Lebanon 
are 
not 
the 
type 
of 
the 
conqueror'
s 
army, 
but 
his 
victims. 
The 
cedars 
were 
a 
valuable 
prize 
to 
any 
great 
warriorbuilder. 
So 
in 
Ezek. 
xvii. 3, 
Babylon, 
in 
the 
likeness 
of 
an 
eagle, 
ἔχει 
τὸ 
ἥγημα

εἷς

Λίβανον, 
καὶ 
ἔλαβε

ἐπίλεκτα 
τῆς 
κέδρου.
ὁ 
ᾅδης] 
See 
on 
v. 
ἐπικράνθη] 
Heb. 
‘is 
disturbed,' 
whether 
with 
trembling 
or 
wrath: 
the 
same 
root 
as 
the 
word 
rendered 
by 
θυμοῦ, 
ver. 3; 
θυμωθήσεται 
is 
used 
for 
the 
verb, 
xiii. 13: 
παροξύνων, 
below, 
ver. 
συνηγέρθησαν] 
The 
voice 
of 
the 
verb 
and 
its 
number 
are 
different 
from 
the 
Heb., 
as 
well 
as 
the 
number 
of 
ἐγείραντες, 
so 
that 
both 
are 
made 
to 
refer 
to 
the 
giants, 
the 
meaning 
being 
hard 
to 
ﬁnd: 
either 
the 
giants 
are 
ﬁrst 
roused, 
and 
then 
rouse 
the 
kings, 
or 
perhaps 
more 
reasonably 
ἐγείραντες 
is 
more 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
the 
Heb. 
‘disturbed.’ 
The 
giants 
are 
angered 
and 
appalled 
at 
the 
new 
arrival, 
as 
kings 
had 
been 
at 
them.
γίγαντας] 
Heb. 
Rephaim, 
a—
or 
words, 
for 
there 
are 
probably 
at 
least 
two 
roots 
concerned—
with 
several 
meanings, 
the 
cause 
much 
confusion 
in 
the 
versions:
(a) 
a 
people 
living 
apparently 
E. 
of 
Jordan, 
Gen. 
xiv. 5 
(γίγαντας 
XV. 20 
('Ραφαείμ).
(b)

resembling, 
or 
descended 
from

Deut.

('Ραφαεὶν 
or 
Ῥαφαείμ);

or 
a 
proper 
name, 2 
Sam. 
xxi. 
(ὁ 
Ῥαφά, 
τῶν

and

Mistakes 
between 
(a) 
and 
(b) 
are 
less 
important, 
and 
(c) 
is 
generally 
secured 
by 
the 
context: 
but 
(d) 
causes 
difficulty,

Kay) 
as

(LXX.

δράκοντος) 
and 
Zech. 
x. 3 
(ἀμνοὺς) 
the 
metaphor 
is 
worked 
out.
It 
is 
a 
question 
how 
far 
the 
Shades' 
address 
to 
the 
king 
of 
Babylon 
extends. 
Delitzsch 
allows 
only 
ver. 10; 
Skinner 
doubts 
as 
to 
ver. 11. 
and 
adds, 
“it 
certainly 
does 
not 
further.”

in 
the

Many 
authorities, 
but 
not 
Kay, 
take 
the 
latter,  
 however, 
as 
a 
question. 
LXX. 
and 
Vulg. 
are 
generally 
printed 
as 
a 
plain 
statement.
ἁλῶναι, 
in 
the 
sense 
‘to

vanquished,' 
is 
near 
the 
Hebrew, 
but 
not 
exact.

πολλὴ 
suggests 
that 
LXX. 
interpreted 
as 
is 
often 
used, 
of 
multitude 
or 
abundance, 
rather 
than 
of 
musical 
sound. 
Feasting 
was 
the 
order 
of 
the 
night, 
it 
may 
be, 
before 
the 
fall 
of 
Babylon 
and 
of 
many 
an 
ancient 
strong 
city. 
It 
may 
be 
noticed 
that 
nowhere 
in 
Dan. 
v. 
are 
Belshazzar'
s 
feast 
and 
death 
said 
to 
have 
taken 
place 
in 
Babylon, 
so 
that 
the 
historic 
accuracy 
of 
the 
chapter 
cannot 
be 
impugned 
on 
that 
ground.

Prof. 
Skinner 
is 
surely 
right 
in 
defending 
A.
V.'
s 
rendering 
‘Lucifer’: 
he 
points 
out 
how 
this 
name 
came 
to 
be 
applied 
to 
the

by 
connecting 
this

with 
Luke

That

Macaulay, 
in 
the

brilliantly 
applies 
this 
passage 
to 
the

Α 
paraphrase

‘son

the

used 
in 
viii. 20, 
xlvii. 11, 
unless, 
as 
Prof. 
Margoliouth 
thinks 
(Lines 
of 
Defence, 
p. 128), 
the 
word 
in 
one 
or 
both 
of 
those 
passages 
comes 
from 
another 
root, 
found 
in 
Arabic,

here 
Lxx. 
misread 
ΑBBREV 
participle 
of 
‘discomﬁt,’ 
‘weaken,’ 
and 
took 
it 
from 
‘send,’ 
transposing 
the 
letters. 
Both 
verbs 
may 
be 
followed 
by 
the 
preposition 
which 
LXX. 
perhaps 
read 
again 
as 53, 
since 
they 
insert 
πάντα.
We 
are 
reminded 
of 
the 
Tower 
of 
Babel, 
but 
it 
is 
not 
easy 
to 
ﬁnd 
a 
complete 
parallel 
to 
this 
enormous 
pride. 
See 
however 
the  
 difficult 
chapter, 
Ezekiel 
xxviii. 
The 
ascription 
of 
divine 
origin 
to 
Greek 
heroes 
and 
their 
houses 
is 
on 
a 
different 
plane 
altogether, 
and 
the 
defication 
of 
Roman 
emperors 
a 
mere 
mockery 
and 
degradation 
of 
the 
gods 
in 
which 
few 
had 
any 
real 
belief. 
Nearer 
parallels 
may 
however 
be 
found 
in 
Indian 
mythology: 
a 
convenient 
example 
may 
be 
quoted 
from 
Southey'
s 
Curse 
of 
Kehama 
(xii. 8): 
“Up 
rose 
the 
Rajah 
through 
the 
conquer'
d 
sky,
To 
seize 
the 
Swerga 
for 
his 
proud 
abode;
Myriads 
of 
evil 
Genii 
round 
him 
ﬂy,
As 
royally 
on 
wings 
of 
winds 
he 
rode,
And 
scaled 
high 
Heaven, 
triumphant 
like 
a 
Godl.'
ὑψηλῷ] 
This 
clause 
paraphrases 
the 
Heb.; 
it 
is 
just 
possible 
that 
‘assembly,’ 
was 
read 
as 
‘power,’ 
‘excess,’ 
generally 
used 
adverbially, 
often 
rendered 
σφόδρα.
Tertullian, 
adv. 
Marc. 
ν. 23, 
quotes 
loosely, 
“Ero 
similis 
altissimi, 
ponam 
in 
nubibus 
thronum 
meum." 
Tyconius, 
pp. 72, 74, 
has 
“Ascendam 
super 
nubes, 
ero 
similis 
Altissimo." 
Mr 
Burkitt 
points 
out 
in 
his 
Introduction, 
p. 
lix., 
that 
in 
ver. 13 
Tyconius 
agrees 
with 
Cyprian 
in 
reading 
‘stellas 
Dei': 
“Is 
it 
possible," 
he 
asks, 
“that 
οݲ

υݲ 
of

that

the

been 
preserved 
only 
in 
the

θεμελια] 
Heb. 
‘sides’ 
or 
‘recesses’: 
word 
already 
used 
in 
ver. 13, 
but 
not 
directly 
rendered 
there: 
of 
a 
ship, 
jonah 
i. 5 
(κοίλην).
Οὗτος

Heb.

interrogative. 
θαυμάσουσιν

a 
rather 
loose

expresses 
the 
general 
sense.

Scholz

suggested 
by 
the 
similar 
letters.
μετὰ

Although 
a 
similar 
metaphor 
occurs 
in 
ver. 11, 
LXX. 
have 
paraphrased 
‘clothed 
with 
the 
slain': 
cf. 
Ps. 
lxv. 13 
εἰς 
ᾅδου] 
Heb. 
has 
here 
‘to 
the 
stones 
of 
the 
pit.
The 
discrepancies 
increase. 
ὃν 
τρόπον 
ἱμάτιον 
must 
be 
read 
for 
‘like 
a 
carcase,' 
and 
καθαρὸν 
probably 
for 
‘thou 
shalt 
be 
joined' 
(so 
Scholz, 
who 
assigns 
the 
mistakes 
to 
sound, 
but 
there 
is 
also 
the 
common 
confusion 
of 
and 
There 
is 
a 
perceptible 
resemblance 
to 
the 
Heb., 
rather 
than 
the 
LXX. 
of 
ix. 4. 
ἐν 
αἵματι 
πεφυρμένον 
is 
interpreted 
as 
in 
Ezek. 
xvi. 6, 22. 
Then 
‘with 
them,' 
was 
read 
as 
σύ. 
Lastly, 
καθαρός, 
if 
not 
added 
to 
complete 
the 
sense, 
would 
seem 
to 
be 
‘cleansed,’ 
for 
 perhaps 
with 
some 
confusion 
with 
above.
σπέρμα 
πονηρὸν] 
The 
same 
phrase 
(in 
Heb. 
also) 
as 
in 
i. 4 
not 
found 
elsewhere.
τὸ, 
τέκνα, 
σου] 
Heb. 
'his 
sons,' 
the 
difference 
of 
‘thy’ 
and 
‘his.’ 
After 
πατρὸς 
have 
σου, 
probably 
to 
match 
the 
previous 
clanse, 
B 
and 
the 
later 
versions 
agreeing 
with 
the 
Heb., 
reading 
αὐτῶν.
πολέμων] 
Heb. 
‘cities,’ 
ABREV 
or, 
as 
some 
render 
it 
‘enemies’: 
so 
in 
Dan. 
iv. 19 (16 
Aramaic), 
Lxx. 
and 
Theodotion 
have 
τοῖς 
ἐχθροῖς 
σου. 
Here 
the 
later 
Greek 
versions 
all 
have 
πόλεων, 
which 
is 
read 
by 
V 109 305 307 308. 
The 
evidence 
of 
Syrohex. 
is 
divided. 
Cheyne 
(following 
Hitizig?) 
wished 
to 
read 
‘heaps’: 
Ewald 
to 
alter 
more 
considerably 
to 
‘terrible 
ones.' 
The 
resemblance 
between 
‘cities’ 
and 
‘enemies’ 
in 
Greek, 
and 
the 
identity 
of 
form 
in 
Heb., 
is 
curious, 
but 
has 
probably 
little 
to 
do 
with 
the 
real 
issue. 
Probably 
πολέμων, 
if 
not 
altered 
or 
corrupted 
from 
πολεμίων, 
is 
the 
real 
LXX.; 
being 
as 
near 
to 
the 
original 
‘enemies,’ 
if 
so 
rendered, 
as 
the 
translators 
might 
be 
expected 
to 
go. 
In 
Ps. 
lxxiii. 20 
Lxx. 
(and 
Vulg.) 
have 
the 
converse 
difference. 
See 
Vol. 
I. 
Introd. 
p. 29. 
As 
to 
the 
alternative 
renderings 
of 
the 
Hebrew, 
‘cities’ 
appears 
to 
give 
the 
best 
sense: 
building 
being 
a 
favourite 
occupation 
of 
great 
conquerors, 
and 
almost 
an 
inherited 
tradition 
of 
the 
empire 
of 
Babel. 
See 
Kay'
s 
introductory 
remarks 
to 
chap. 
xiii., 
xiv.

Βαβυλωνίαν] 
The 
pronoun 
and

name

Heb. 
have 
exchanged 
places.
σπέρμα] 
Heb. 
‘issue 
and 
offspring,' 
an 
alliterative 
pair: 
σπέρμα 
also 
in 
Gen. 
xxi. 23 
but 
coupled 
with 
ὄνομα: 
in 
Job 
xviii. 19 
ἐπίγνωστος. 
A.
V. 
‘nephew’ 
is 
doubtless 
used 
in 
its 
old 
sense, = 
‘grandson' 
(nepos). 
Scholz 
thinks 
the 
second 
word 
of 
the 
pair 
has 
been 
read 
into 
τάδε; 
for 
but 
apart 
from 
the 
slightness 
of 
the 
resemblance, 
the 
rendering 
in 
Genesis 
is 
against 
this.
Cf. 
xiii. 21, 
ἐχίνους] 
Cf. 
xxxiv. 11, 
Zeph. 
ii. 14. 
Many 
support 
this 
rendering 
of 
the 
Heb.; 
others, 
with 
A.
V., 
think 
the 
bittem 
is 
meant, 
a 
marshbird, 
formerly 
found 
in 
England. 
This 
seems 
on 
the 
whole 
preferable; 
its 
habits 
are 
suitable, 
and 
a 
bird 
seems 
necessary 
for 
the 
verse 
in 
Zephaniah. 
The 
bittern'
s 
alleged 
habit 
of 
rolling 
itself 
up 
like 
a 
hedgehog 
seems 
only 
worth 
mentioning 
on 
the 
chance 
that 
the 
name 
of 
one 
creature 
might 
be 
transferred 
to 
the 
other.
βάραθρον] 
Α 
reads 
βάθρον= 
'foundation' 
or 
‘pedestal’: 
probably 
here 
a 
slip, 
though 
found 
also 
in 109 305 : 
or 
for 
βόθρον, 
as 
Ezek. 
xxxi. 14 
xxxii. 18, 
&amp;
c. 
The 
latter 
part 
of 
the 
verse 
is 
paraphrased, 
and 
two 
phrases, 
‘The 
Lord 
of 
Hosts 
declareth,' 
and 
‘The 
Lord 
of 
Hosts 
hath 
sworn,' 
are 
represented 
only 
once.
The 
next 
four 
verses, 
with 
a 
sudden 
transition, 
deal 
with 
Assyria'
s 
fall. 
From 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
those 
who 
maintain 
the 
unity 
of 
the 
Book 
of 
Isaiah. 
Delitzsch 
(ed. 3) 
explained 
thus: 
“Asshur 
perishes"... 
"Only 
after 
this 
had 
taken 
place 
could 
a 
prophecy 
against 
Babel, 
the 
inheritress 
of 
the 
broken 
worldpower 
of 
Assyria, 
be 
appropriate. 
The 
two 
prophecies 
against 
Babel 
and 
Asshur, 
therefore, 
as 
they 
stand 
here, 
form 
a 
Hysteron 
proteron." 
He 
proceeds 
to 
compare 
Jer. 1. 
(xxvii.) 18:

Ἀσσούρ 
“The 
one 
event 
is 
the 
guarantee 
of 
the 
other." 
Ver. 26, 27, 
he 
adds, 
have 
“quite 
the 
tone 
of 
epilogue.”
Most 
modern 
critics 
assign 
ver. 24—32 
to 
Isaiah, 
while 
his 
authorship 
of 
xiii.. 
xiv. 1—23. 
They 
generally 
divide 
the 
dating 24—27 
after, 
rather 
than 
before 
This 
verse, 
in 
itself, 
might 
have 
stood 
in 
connection 
with 
what 
precedes: 
cf.

different.
It 
is 
generally 
agreed 
that 
this 
verse 
is 
the 
heading 
to 
the 
passage 
that 
follows. 
The 
Heb. 
demonstrative 
used 
favours 
this 
view 
(Davidson, 
Heb. 
Syntax, § 4) 
and 
such 
indications 
of 
date 
stand 
elsewhere 
at 
the 
beginning 
rather 
than 
the 
end 
of 
a 
prOphecy. 
As 
far 
as 
the 
Greek 
is 
concerned, 
the 
LXX. 
cannot 
be 
said 
to 
maintain 
the 
old 
distinction 
in 
the 
use 
of 
οὗτος 
and 
ὅδε: 
see 
ver. 4, 
τὸν 
θρῆνον 
τοῦτον. 
Α 
further 
question 
is, 
whether 
‘in 
the 
year 
that 
king 
A. 
died' 
means 
before 
or 
after 
his 
death. 
The 
same 
difficulty 
occurs 
in 
vi. 1. 
Kay 
thinks 
after, 
Cheyne 
and 
Delitzsch 
before. 
The 
point 
is 
probably 
impossible 
to 
decide: 
and 
the 
range 
of 
time 
is 
probably 
not 
great; 
what 
seems 
to 
be 
clearly 
indicated 
in 
each 
case 
is, 
that 
the 
king'
s 
death, 
either 
as 
imminent, 
or 
as 
recent, 
was 
the 
prominent 
event 
in 
the 
mind 
in 
connection 
with 
the 
utterance 
of 
the 
prophecy.
πάντες 
οἱ 
ἀλλόφυλοι] 
Heb. 
‘Philistia, 
all 
of 
thee.' 
See 
on 
ii. 6. 
‘Palestina’ 
of 
A.
V. 
reminds 
us 
that 
that 
name 
for 
the 
country 
is 
derived 
from 
the 
Philistines; 
which, 
though 
curious, 
is 
not 
without 
parallel: 
England 
and 
France 
themselves 
bear 
their 
names 
under 
somewhat 
similar 
conditions.
ὅ 
ζυγὸς] 
See 
on 
ver. 
ἔγγονα 
ἀσπίδων] 
The 
phrase 
occurs 
also 
xi. 8 
(same 
Heb.) 
and 
xxx. 6 
(diff. 
Heb.) 
while 
present 
Heb. 
is 
ἀσπίδων, 
lix. 
The 
Philistines 
are 
warned 
not 
to 
exult 
over 
the 
death 
of 
some 
enemy, 
because 
his 
successor 
will 
be 
more 
terrible; 
and 
the 
third 
more 
terrible 
again 
(unless 
the 
‘ﬁery 
serpent' 
is 
taken 
as 
simply 
parallel 
to 
the 
‘viper’). 
Delitzsch, 
following 
the 
Targum 
and 
Jerome, 
interprets 
of 
the 
kings 
of 
the 
line 
of 
Judah, 
culminating 
in 
the 
Messiah: 
his 
note 
should 
be 
consulted, 
to 
do 
his 
view 
justice; 
but 
the 
reference 
to 
Gen. 
xlix. 17 
and 
the 
Danite 
origin 
of 
Samson 
the 
’s 
great 
enemy 
seems 
beside 
the 
mark, 
and 
on 
general 
grounds 
the 
serpent 
is 
the 
last 
comparison 
to 
the 
Davidic 
dynasty 
that 
would 
be 
expected. 
Most 
modems 
(Kay, 
Cheyne, 
Driver, 
Skinner, 
W. 
E. 
Barnes, 
&amp;
c.) 
take 
it 
of 
Assyrian 
kings. 
According 
to 
the 
as 
generally 
accepted 
as 
any 
at 
the 
present 
day, 
TiglathPileser 
died 
in 
the 
same 
year 
as 
Ahaz, 
or 
in 
the 
year 
before 
or 
after. 
‘From 
the  
 north,' 
in 
ver. 31, 
may 
be 
held 
to 
suit 
the 
Assyrian: 
though 
other 
conquerors 
come 
from 
the 
north, 
chap. 
xli. 25, 
Jerem. 
I. 3,

Scholz 
thinks 
this 
is 
‘the

read 
as 
‘in’ 
or 
‘by 
him': 
:perhaps 
rather 
lit. 
‘by

i.
e. 
‘by

ἀνελεῖ...
ἀνελεῖ] 
Two 
different 
Heb. 
verbs 
are 
used, 
the 
former 
in 
the 
ﬁrst 
person; 
but 
owing 
to 
its 
termination, 
the 
difference 
between 1 
and 3 
pers. 
is 
not 
great.
πόλει 
πόλων] 
The 
phrase 
πύλαι 
τῶν 
πόλεων 
occurs 
also 
wrongly 
in 
Nah. 
ii. 6 
ποταμῶν ℵ*). 
The 
Heb. 
word 
for 
‘gate’ 
sometimes 
used 
for 
‘city,’ 
so 
that 
a 
kind 
of 
duplicate 
may 
have 
arisen 
by 
confusion, 
or 
as 
an 
explanation. 
The 
Heb. 
word, 
to 
which 
τεταραγμέναι 
corresponds, 
refers 
to 
Philistia, 
so 
that 
the 
syntax 
differs 
considerably.
καπνὸς] 
Of 
ﬁres 
along 
the 
invaders' 
track, 
according 
to 
some 
commentators: 
but 
see 
Jer. 
i. 13, 
τοῦ 
εἶναι] 
Some 
words 
seem 
to 
have 
dropped 
out 
from 
the 
Greek, 
in 
rendering 
or 
in 
transmission. 
The 
Lucianic 
cursives 
generally 
read 
τοῦ 
μεῖναι 
ἐν 
τοῖς 
συντεταγμένοις 
αὐτοῦ 
or 
similar 
words: 
and 106 301 (144 233) 
read 
μεῖναι, 
which 
is 
perhaps 
right, 
representing 
 read 
as 
or 
cf. 
x. 32, 
the 
Lucianic 
reading 
then 
containing 
a 
doublet. 
It 
should 
however 
be 
noticed 
that 
Tyconius 
twice 
(pp. 71 77) 
represents 
οὗ 
μὴ 
μείνῃς, 
ver. 20 
of 
this 
chapter, 
by 
non 
eris.
βασιλεῖς] 
Heb. 
‘messengers,’ 
an 
easy 
mistake 
for 
LXX. 
to 
make, 
between 
and 
cf. 
xlii. 19, 
οἱ 
κυριεύοντες 
αὐτῶν. 
Some 
think 
the 
words 
have 
been 
confused 
in 
the 
Heb. 
text 
of 2 
Kings 
vi. 
ταπεινοὶ] 
On 
this 
word, 
and 
πτωχοὶ 
in 
ver. 30, 
see 
on 
x. 
XV. 
The 
doom 
of 
Moab. 
With 
this 
and 
the 
following 
chapter 
compare 
Jerem. 
xlviii. 
(xxxi.); 
esp. 
Jerem. 
xlviii. 3, 5, 
with 
Isai. 
xv. 5 29, 30 
with 
xvi. 6; 31—33 
with 
xvi. 7—11; 34 
with 
xv. 46 
xvi. 11; 37 
with 
xv. 2. 
Notice 
also 
the 
resemblance 
of 
Jerem. 
xlviii. 43, 44 
to 
Isai. 
xxiv. 17, 18, 
and 
of 45, 46 
to 
Numb. 
xxi. 28, 
Modern 
critics 
have 
their 
doubts 
as 
to 
Isaiah'
s 
authorship, 
gemerally 
however 
excepting 
xvi. (4 
b) 5, 
and 13, 14. 
The 
style 
of 
the 
rest 
is 
considered 
somewhat 
archaic; 
Gesenius 
has 
been 
followed 
by 
many 
in 
his 
idea 
that 
Isaiah 
took 
up 
an 
older 
prophecy, 
adding 
an 
epilogue 
of 
his 
own: 
Hitzig 
guessed 
Jonah 
as 
the 
author: 
the 
occasion 
of 
the 
prophecy 
is 
unknown; 
a 
supposed 
invasion 
of 
Moab 
by 
Jeroboam 
II. 
of 
Israel 
has 
been 
suggested.

This

form 
occurs 
also 
in 
ver. 4, 5, 8, 
xvi. 7, 
and  
 xxv. 10. 
It 
probably 
means 
‘the 
land 
of 
Moab,' 
rather 
than 
‘the 
daughter 
of 
Moab' 
(θυγάτηρ

occurs, 
xvi. 2), 
or 
even 
the 
personified

though 
it 
may 
approximate 
to 
the 
latter; 
for 
in 
Jer.

it

mean 
‘nobles’; 
by 
others,

The

more 
probably

the

the

thus, 
and 
the 
rendering

would 
in 
this

be 
natural 
enough : 
compare 
Ps.

that

sometimes 
called

Ἀδαμὰ] 
Heb. 
Adāmah=‘
ground,’ 
‘land’; 
treated 
by 
LXX. 
as 
proper 
name: 
it 
has 
been 
suggested 
that 
Moab, 
as 
descended 
from 
Lot, 
might 
be 
spoken 
of 
as 
a 
remnant 
of 
Admah, 
one 
of 
the 
neighbour 
cities 
of 
Sodom 
and 
Gomorrah 
(Gen. 
xiv. 2,

The 
divergence 
of 
LXX. 
from 
Heb. 
at 
the 
opening 
of 
this 
chapter 
is 
curious, 
but 
easily 
explained. 
The 
words 
have 
been 
differently 
divided: 
after 
the 
difference 
of 
person 
between 
‘Send 
ye, 
and 
ἀποστελῶ, 
or 
‘prophetic 
perfect,' 
we 
have, 
Heb. 
the 
lamb 
(to) 
the 
ruler 
of 
the 
land, 
LXX. 
ὡς 
ἑρπετὰ

γῆν 
 or 
simply 
and 
perhaps 
rather 
So 
Scholz; 
indeed, 
the 
state 
of 
the 
case 
is 
palpable. 
It 
can 
hardly 
be 
doubted 
that 
the 
Heb. 
text 
is 
right: 
the 
tribute 
of 
sheep 
from 
Moab 
is 
referred 
to, 2 
Kings 
iii. 4. 
Moab 
is 
now 
advised 
to 
return 
to 
its 
old 
allegiance. 
It 
is 
doubtful 
whether 
the 
fugitives, 
in 
the 
following 
verses, 
are 
those 
of 
Judah 
or 
Israel, 
forced 
over 
the 
border 
into 
Moab, 
or 
Moabites, 
themselves 
in 
distress: 
some 
’are 
ambiguous, 
both 
in 
Heb. 
and 
Greek: 
Moab 
afforded 
a 
refuge 
to 
Elimelech, 
Ruth 
i. 
I, 
and 
to 
David'
s 
family, 
I 
Sam. 
xxii. 3, 4: 
but 
the 
prophecy 
seems 
to 
be 
concerned 
with 
the 
fate 
of 
Moab, 
exclusively: 
and 
most 
modern 
authorities 
take 
this 
view. 
Possibly, 
therefore, 
the 
texttranslation 
of 
ver. 
4a, 
and 
that 
in 
the 
footnote, 
Vol. 
I. 
p. 125, 
should 
exchange 
places: 
but 
the 
question 
remains 
very 
uncertain.

The

a

into 
various 
adverbial 
or 
prepositional 
phrases 
meaning

Scholz,

as 
most, 
if 
not  
 texts 
previous 
to 
the 
Camb. 
Lxx.

(so 
BbQa), 
explains 
it 
as 
 i.
e. 
I 
suppose, 
as 
for 
πλείονα 
may 
be 
to 
complete 
the 
sense 
of 
ἐπὶ 
τάδε, 
or 
a 
paraphrase 
of 
the 
Heb. 
verb 
with 
‘counsel’: 
which 
means, 
‘make 
to 
go,' 
'adnace' : 
as 
in 
the 
phrase 
‘stricken 
in 
years,' 
lit. 
‘advanced 
in 
days.
ποίει 
τι 
σκέπην] 
The 
syntax 
differs 
here 
in 
Greek 
and 
Heb., 
and 
there 
seems 
to 
be 
some 
confusion. 
ποίει 
τε 
corresponds 
to 
 ‘execute’; 
if 
read 
ποιεῖτε, 
Heb. 
margin 
has 
the 
plur.: 
σκέπην, 
except 
for 
the 
order, 
should 
correspond 
to 153, 
‘thy 
shadow,' 
but 
possibly 
this 
word 
ςγ, 
which 
has 
a 
form 
ςςχ, 
was 
confused 
with 
in 
this 
case 
‘make,’ 
‘set,’ 
may 
have 
been 
read 
as 
a 
‘complaint’; 
διὰ 
παντὸς 
is 
then 
‘as 
the 
night,' 
read 
as 
the 
adverb 
‘entirely,’ 
with 
different 
vowelpoints: 
ἐν 
μεσημβρινῇ 
agrees 
With 
Heb., 
σκοτίᾳ 
is 
the 
verb 
‘hide,’ 
taken 
as 
a 
noun, 
‘a 
secret 
place,' 
omitting 
r; 
φεύγουσιν, 
ἐξέστησαν, 
are 
‘outcasts,’ 
‘wanderers,’ 
two 
participles 
taken 
as 
equivalent 
to 
verbs.

but 
the

μὴ

is 
most 
probably 
right,—
see

it

to

read 
with 
different 
vowelpoints 
as 
a 
passive 
of 
the 
same 
verb, 
in 
the 
sense 
‘be 
not 
led 
away' 
(captive). 
The 
readings 
ἀχθεσθείς, 62 147 
and 
ἀχθεσθῇς, 93, 
seem 
to 
come 
from 
taking 
ἀχθῇς 
(intransitively) 
from 
ἀχθέω; 
ἐπειχθῇς, 41 306, 
might 
possibly 
be 
the 
true 
reading, 
but 
seems 
quite 
as 
likely 
to 
be 
a 
mixture 
of 
A'
s 
and 
B'
s 
texts. 
The 
Syrohexaplar 
version 
gives 
in 
its 
text, 
according 
to 
Field, 
the 
equivalent 
of 
μὴ 
ἀχθεσθῇς, 
in 
the 
margin 
that 
of 
μὴ 
ταραχθῇς, 
each 
of 
them 
fairly 
reasonable 
attempts 
to 
get 
sense. 
A'
s 
reading 
is 
puzzling: 
it 
may 
be 
(a) 
a 
corruption 
from 
ἀπαχθῇς, 
or 
some 
other 
verb : 
(b) 
ἀπ’ 
ἀρχῆς, 
an 
additional 
phrase 
of 
the 
Lxx., 
which 
has 
turned 
out 
the 
verb 
from 
the 
clause, 
owing 
to 
its 
being 
itself 
mistaken 
for 
a 
verb: 
it 
is 
not 
easy, 
however, 
to 
account 
for 
its 
presence 
in 
this 
character : 
(c) 
from 
ἀπόρχω, 
‘rule 
afar 
off,' 
almost=
rule 
in 
exile. 
Pind. 
Nem. 
IV. 76, 
ἔνθα 
Τεῦκρος 
ἀπάρχει. 
In 
this 
case 
we 
may 
render 
‘lest 
thou 
be 
an 
exile,' 
or 
‘see 
lest 
thou 
be,’ 
as 
the 
pres. 
subj. 
cannot 
properly 
be 
prohibitive.
Μωὰβ] 
On 
the 
whole, 
best 
taken 
as 
genitive 
after 
φυγάδες, 
and 
so 
also 
Heb.: 
some, 
however, 
treat 
it 
as 
a 
vocative 
in 
Heb., 
and 
if 
so, 
it 
might 
also 
be 
so 
in 
Greek.
ἤρθη] 
Perhaps 
can, 
‘there 
is 
none,' 
read 
as 
‘take

so 
Scholz ; 
but 
this 
would 
not 
be 
passive, 
and 
the 
difference 
in 
meaning 
is 
here 
slight.
συμμαχία] 
Heb. 
‘extortioner’; 
the 
discrepancy 
is 
hard 
to 
account 
for.
συνετελέσθη 
ταλαιπωρία] 
These 
words, 
found 
only 
in 
A 49 106, 
are 
perhaps 
Hexaplaric, 
inserted 
from 
Symmachus. 
They 
agree 
pretty 
well 
with 
Heb.
ὁ

An 
addition 
to 
explain 
ὁ 
καταπατῶν: 
probably 
not 
a. 
duplicate 
and 
periphrastic 
rendering, 
by 
the 
order 
of 
words.
ἐπὶ] 
So 
ℵAQ* 24 26 41 49 106 109 239 301 305 306 309: 
B 
ἀπὸ, 
which 
agrees 
with 
Heb., 
and 
may 
be 
Hexaplaric, 
from 
Aquila: 
otherwise, 
ἐπὶ 
may 
be 
an 
alteration 
to 
suit 
κατοπατῶν: 
in 
some 
ways 
this 
seems 
more 
likely.
ἔξῆρας] 
SO 
ℵcbABabQ* 26 49 106: 
ἐξῆρα 
ℵ*B*, 
preferable, 
though 
as 
the 
word 
is 
in 
any 
case 
an 
error, 
there 
is 
little 
in 
the 
context 
or 
otherwise 
to 
decide 
upon. 
Heb. 
has 
‘and 
his 
wrath' 
(a 
feeling 
that 
passes 
bounds): 
ἐξῆρα 
is 
due 
to 
reading 
‘I 
took 
(caused 
to 
pass) 
away': 
the 
2nd 
pers. 
would 
be 
without 
ﬁnal’.
οὐχ 
οὕτως] 
This 
is 
right 
the 
ﬁrst 
time, 
Heb. 
the 
second 
time 
Heb. 
has 
‘Therefore....’ 
beginning 
the 
next 
verse. 
Cf. 
Jerem. 
xlviii. 
(xxxi.) 30, 31, 
and 
see 
on 
x. 15. 
The 
Heb. 
‘not 
so 
means 
here 
almost 
‘vanity,’ 
‘absurdity’: 
cf. 2 
Kings 
vii. 9, 
οὐχ 
οὕτως 
ποιοῦμεν, 
almost='
this 
is 
not 
the 
way 
to 
behave'; 2 
Sam. 
xxiii. 5 
‘my 
house 
is 
not 
so 
(not 
right) 
with 
God.
μαντεία] 
Heb. 
‘boastings’ 
or 
‘pratings’: 
Lxx. 
interprets 
of 
(lying) 
divinations, 
Cf. 
xliv. 25, 
ἐγγαστριμύθων.
τοῖς 
κατοικοῦσιν 
Δέσεθ] 
Scholz, 
taking 
the 
division 
of 
words 
δὲ 
Σέθ, 
as 
in 
the 
old 
editions, 
considers 
that 
LXX. 
read 
 omitting 
Kir: 
the 
Heb. 
is 
generally 
now 
translated 
'raisincakes,' 
but 
is 
not 
very 
certain : 
the 
older 
authorities 
generally 
made 
it 
‘foundations.’ 
The 
parallel 
verse 
in 
Jeremiah 
has 
‘men’; 
the 
verb 
in 
xlvi. 8, 
with 
root 
letters 
like 
the 
present 
word, 
has 
often, 
though 
according 
to 
modern 
authority 
wrongly, 
been 
connected 
with 
trim, 
‘a 
man.' 
It 
seems 
likely, 
therefore, 
that 
LXX., 
either 
connecting 
 with 
or 
by 
guess 
work, 
paraphrased 
with 
τοῖς 
κατοικοῦσιν, 
and 
Δέσεθ 
is 
the 
common 
reading 
of 
for 
Kir, 
as 
Scholz 
thinks, 
being 
omitted, 
and 
only 
n 
remaining 
unaccounted 
for.
μελετήσας] 
This 
verb 
in 
LXx. 
often 
represents 
which = 
moum,' 
and 
also 
‘meditate’: 
xxxviii. 14, 
lix. 3, 13. 
Its 
sense 
here 
is 
not 
very 
clear.
καὶ 
οὐκ 
ἐντραπήση] 
Heb. 
has 
no 
negative: 
Lowth 
suggested 
therefore 
that 
LXX. 
read 
for 
and, 
with 
further 
alteration 
both 
of 
Heb. 
and 
Greek, 
that 
ἐντροπήσῃ 
represents 
Niphal 
of 
 instead 
of 
Scholz 
rather 
vaguely, 
“Entweder 
von 
Oder  
Compare 
ver. 12 
ἐντραπῆναι: 
and 
for 
this 
verb 
representing 
Niph. 
of 
see 
xli. 11, 
xlv. 16, 17, 1. 
καταπίνοντες] 
Reading 
‘swallowing 
up,' 
for 
'lords' 
cf. 
Numb. 
xxi. 28, 
where 
Lxx. 
has 
κατέπιεν 
στῆλαι· 
Ἀρνών. 
The 
Heb. 
is 
ambiguous: 
‘the 
lords 
of 
nations 
her 
choice 
plants 
struck 
down, 
some 
authorities 
making 
‘lords’ 
the 
subj. 
of 
the 
verb, 
and 
‘plants’ 
the 
obj., 
others 
the 
converse: 
but 
this 
παρὰ 
προσδοκίαν 
seems 
hardly 
befitting 
to 
attribute 
to 
a 
Hebrew 
prophet.
οὗ 
μὴ

Heb. 
has 
again 
no 
negative 
here; 
the 
verb 
in 
Heb. 
belongs 
to 
the 
previous 
clause, 
and 
is 
3rd 
pers. 
plur., 
a 
difference 
of 
vowelpoints
οἱ 
ἀπεσταλμένοι] 
Heb. 
‘offshoots’ 
is 
from 
root 
meaning 
‘send

Heb. 
verb 
‘to 
be 
spread 
abroad' 
also 
means 
‘to 
be 
left.
τὰ 
δένδρα 
σου] 
Scholz 
suggests, 
but 
doubtfully, 
that 
LXX. 
read 
hat, 
i.
e. 
‘thy 
cedars' 
for 
‘I 
will 
water 
thee.
κατέβαλεν] 
Heb. 
‘with 
my 
tears': 
what 
verb 
LXX. 
read 
is 
open 
to 
doubt: 
perhaps 
‘destroyed’ 
or 
‘threw 
down,' 
instead 
of 
&lt;

Compare 
xv. 4. 
The 
corruption 
have 
taken 
place 
here 
ﬁrst, 
as 
its 
support 
is 
somewhat 
wider: 
ἐλάλησεν 
is 
repeated 
in 
the 
Greek 
of 
ver. 13 
below.
καταπατῆσαι] 
Heb. 
‘shouting’: 
perhaps 
a 
loose 
interpretation 
or 
guess, 
connecting 
the 
word 
with 
the 
treading 
of 
the 
grapes. 
Or 
may 
have 
been 
read 
as 
or 
from 
‘tread’ 
 with 
same 
meaning, 
differs 
more 
in 
letters). 
Vulg. 
has 
vox 
τῶν 
ἀμπελώνων 
σου] 
Heb. 
‘from 
the 
arden 
land', 
Carmel: 
which 
LXX. 
seems 
to 
have 
read 
as 
for 
Β 
is 
therefore 
probably 
wrong 
in 
omitting 
σου.
πέπανται 
γάμ] 
Some 
Lucianic 
MSS. 
add 
κέλευσμα. 
It 
is 
often 
said 
that 
Mark 
xvi. 8 
breaks 
off 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
a 
sentence, 
γὰρ 
being 
unlikely 
to 
stand 
at 
the 
end 
of 
one. 
But 
if 
this 
verse 
be 
not 
an 
undoubted 
instance, 
Gen. 
xviii. 15, 
xlv. 3 
are 
close 
parallels 
to 
Mark.

ὤσεὶ

Heb. 
‘for

 ὡσεὶ

τεῖχος·

ἐνεκαίνισας

‘renew.’ 
Cf. 
xli. 
ὥς 
τὸ

Heb. 
‘when...

Scholz 
suggests 
that

more 
likely, 
perhaps, 
(Dan. 
xi. 
NBQ 
read 
εἷς 
for

the 
Lucianic 
cursives 
have 
ὥστε

which 
looks 
like 
a 
correction 
of 
the 
Greek. 
After 
the 
infinitive 
and 
σε, 
the 
MSS., 
except 
A, 
have 
ὅτι : 
but 
if 
σε 
represents

as 
this 
must 
be 
a 
duplicate.
χειροποίητα] 
Probably 
an 
interpretation 
of 
Heb. 
'sanctuary': 
though 
it 
may 
be 
that 
LXX. 
read 
for 
οὐ 
μὴ 
δύνηται] 
This 
translates 
the 
Heb., 
except 
that 
the 
original 
verb

not 
here 
auxiliary ; 
so 
that 
ἐξελέσθαι

probably 
added 
to 
complete 
the

e.

LXX. 
renders 
thus, 
cf. 
xxix. 5: 
the 
notion 
seems 
to 
be 
multitude, 
with 
a 
suggestion 
of 
strength.

The

makes 
the

οἱ 
Ἀμορραῖοι 
καὶ 
οἱ 
Εὑαῖοι] 
The 
corresponding 
Hebrew 
words 
are 
‘the 
woodland 
and 
the 
(mountain) 
crest.' 
Many 
commentators 
propose 
to 
emend 
the 
Hebrew 
text 
in 
agreement 
with 
the 
Lxx., 
reading 
 for 
and 
for 
Lagarde 
pointing 
out 
that (??) 
and 
look 
very 
much 
alike 
in 
some 
old 
forms 
of 
script. 
The 
LXX., 
however, 
have 
the 
names 
in 
reverse 
order. 
Some 
have 
wished 
to 
go 
a 
step 
further, 
and 
read 
‘Hittites’ 
for 
'Hivites.' 
These 
attempts 
at 
emendation 
are 
hardly 
advisable, 
though 
the 
reference 
to 
these 
and 
their 
neighbour 
tribes 
is 
undisputed. 
The 
use 
of 
the 
word 
 in 
ver. 6 
and 
ver. 9 
in 
the 
varying 
senses 
of 
a 
'treetop' 
and 
a 
'mountaintop' 
does 
not 
seem 
to 
me 
foreign 
to 
Isaiah'
s 
style, 
though 
some, 
e.
g. 
Prof. 
Cheyne, 
have 
thought 
it 
so.

ἄπιστον] 
Heb. 
has 
two 
phrases, 
to 
neither 
of 
which 
does

The 
second 
clause 
of 
Heb.

strongly 
alliterative,

the

read

(which 
some 
however 
take 
from 
'fence,' 
as 
in 
Song

vii. 2: 
cf. 
a

instead 
of

‘sickness,’ 
‘pain,’

Niph. 
participle 
used 
as 
a 
noun, 
from 
Some 
authorities 
still 
favour 
the 
rendering 
‘inheritance’ 
or 
‘possession,’ 
as 
meaning 
expected 
possession. 
‘Heap,’ 
also 
rendered 
as 
a 
verb, 
‘ﬂeeth 
away,’ 
is 
not 
represented 
in 
LXX.: 
unless 
has 
been 
read 
(εἰς).
ὥσπερ 
πατὴρ] 
‘sorrow,’ 
taken 
as 
‘a 
father,' 
preceded 
by 
 ‘as’: 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
verse 
in 
the 
Greek 
looks 
like 
a 
guess 
to 
supplement 
this 
mistake.
ἀνθρώπου] 
Same 
letters, 
as 
‘deadly,’ 
‘grievous,’

pointing.
On 
this 
short 
passage, 
a 
remarkable 
piece 
of 
wordpainting. 
even 
for 
Isaiah, 
see 
Prof. 
G. 
A. 
Smith, 
in 
the 
Expositor'
s 
Bible. 
Some 
think 
it 
connected 
with 
what 
precedes 
(Delitzsch, 
Hizig), 
others 
with 
what 
follows 
(Gesenius, 
W. 
E. 
Barnes); 
with 
both 
(Vitringa, 
and 
apparently 
Kay) : 
or 
as 
an 
independent 
fragment  
 (Cheyne, 
Albert 
Barnes, 
Skinner, 
Bp 
Lowth). 
Some, 
again, 
refer 
it 
to 
Syria 
and 
her 
allies, 
some 
to 
foreign 
hosts 
unspecified, 
but 
most 
to 
the 
Assyrians: 
which 
last 
the 
language 
certainly 
seems 
to 
suit. 
Abrupt 
transition 
seems 
a 
characteristic 
of 
Isaiah: 
and 
it 
may 
be 
noticed 
that 
references 
to 
the 
Assyrians 
occur 
at 
the 
end 
of 
several 
prophecies, 
however 
the 
fact 
is 
to 
be 
explained : 
vii. 17 
foll., 
xiv.— 27, 
xix. 23—25,

ταραχθήσεσθε] 
LXX. 
is 
rather 
vague 
in 
the 
treatment 
of 
ver. 12, 13; 
here 
the 
Heb. 
verb 
is 
3rd 
pers. 
plur. 
The 
constant 
repetition 
of 
words 
has 
probably 
confused 
the 
translators.
νῶτος] 
Heb. 
‘tumult,’ 
which 
has 
perhaps 
been 
supposed 
to 
come 
from 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
‘make 
level' 
όμαλίσῃ, 
xxviii. 25). 
The 
mistake 
might 
be 
due 
to 
sound, 
or 
to 
the 
Aramaic 
form, 
as 
 Later 
in 
the 
verse 
the 
same 
word 
seems 
to 
be 
rendered 
correctly 
enough 
as 
ἠχήσει: 
while 
in 
ver. 13 
it 
appears 
to 
correspond 
to 
βίᾳ

cf. 
xxviii. 2, 
which 
suggests 
and 
xxx.

The 
spirit 
of 
this 
verse 
is, 
however, 
well 
caught 
in 
the 
translation. 
(Some 
Heb. 
MSS. 
and 
editions 
agree 
with 
LXX. 
and 
Vulg. 
in 
inserting 
‘and’ 
before 
‘he

XVlll. 
Opinions 
have 
differed 
as 
to 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
scene 
depicted 
in 
this 
chapter. 
Some 
have 
thought 
that 
the 
‘messengers’ 
are 
ambassadors 
from 
Ethiopia 
to 
Judah, 
hidden 
to 
return 
to 
their 
own 
country, 
bearing 
the 
’s 
saying 
as 
their 
answer. 
Less 
favoured 
is 
the 
idea 
that 
the 
embassy 
is 
from 
Judah 
to 
Ethiopia 
(though 
see 
xx. 4, 5, 
and 
Ezek. 
xxx. 9); 
while 
perhaps 
the 
majority 
of 
modern 
commentators 
think 
that 
the 
‘messengers’ 
are 
those 
of 
the 
king 
of 
Ethiopia 
sent 
to 
muster 
his 
more 
distant 
forces. 
Again, 
some  
 (as 
Kay) 
think 
that 
the 
remarkably 
described 
nation 
of 
ver. 2 
and 7 
is 
Judah: 
but 
it 
is 
generally, 
and 
more 
reasonably, 
taken 
of 
the 
Ethiopians 
(see 
below). 
The 
prevailing 
view, 
at 
any 
rate, 
is 
that 
Ethiopia 
is 
called 
upon, 
not 
to 
unite 
her 
forces, 
or 
join 
with 
Judah, 
against 
the 
Assyrian; 
but 
to 
witness 
his 
destruction; 
to 
stand 
still, 
and 
see 
the 
salvation 
of 
God, 
and 
in 
days 
to 
come, 
to 
turn 
to 
Him 
with 
offerings.
The 
EthiOpians 
of 
this 
time 
would 
seem 
to 
have 
formed 
the 
best 
element 
in 
the 
EgyptEthiopia 
combination. 
It 
is 
curious 
that 
ancient 
testimony 
is 
generally 
favourable 
to 
them. 
’s 
testimony 
to 
their 
‘blamelessness’ 
(Iliad, 
I. 423) 
must 
not 
be 
unduly 
pressed, 
nor 
perhaps 
that 
of 
Aeschylus, 
Frag. 300, 
γένος 
μὲν 
αἰνεῖν 
ἐκμαθὼν 
ἐπίσταμαι
Αἰθιοπίδος 
γῆς.
 (Memnon 
also 
seems 
to 
be 
presented 
as 
a 
gracious 
type 
of 
manhood.
Herodotus 
says 
of 
them, 111.20, 
λέγονται 
εἶναι 
μέγιστοι 
καὶ 
κάλ· 
λιστοι 
ἀνθρώπων 
πάντων, 
and 
the 
story 
in 
the 
following 
chapter 
gives 
a 
favourable 
impression 
of 
them. 
Isaiah 
himself 
has 
apparently 
neither 
fault 
to 
ﬁnd, 
nor 
woe 
to 
predict 
against 
them: 
whereas 
several 
of 
his 
propheciesconcerning 
foreign 
nations 
are 
sympathetic, 
the 
tone 
is 
here 
almost 
respectful.
The 
Ethiopians, 
often 
important, 
were 
now 
becoming 
for 
the 
time 
dominant 
in 
Egypt. 
In 
’s 
time, 
Tirhakah 
(xxxvii. 9) 
raised 
his 
peOple 
to 
great 
power, 
and 
was 
a 
vigorous 
opponent 
of 
Sennacherib. 
There 
are 
difficulties 
about 
the 
chronology 
here, 
as 
throughout 
the 
whole 
period: 
the 
destruction 
of 
the 
Assyrians 
is 
generally 
dated, 
since 
critics 
have 
placed 
their 
reliance 
on 
the 
Assyrian 
Eponym 
Canon, 
in 701 
B.
C.: 
but 
Tirhakah 
did 
not 
become 
king, 
according 
to 
students 
of 
Egyptian 
history, 
till 
from 
three 
to 
ten 
years 
after 
this: 
though 
an 
Ethiopian 
dynasty 
was 
ruling 
from 
an 
earlier 
date.

This 
verse 
begins 
obscurely 
in 
the 
Heb.: 
the 
word 
’ltsal 
(with 
‘wings’ 
following) 
being 
rendered 
(a) 
‘of 
the 
clangour 
(or 
rustling) 
of ’: 
so 
Gesenius, 
Delitzsch, 
Cheyne, 
c.: 
(b) 
‘of

(i.

Knobel,

is 
probably 
identical 
with 
that

so 
Vulgate, 
Vac

In 
(a) 
the 
‘rustling

is 
supposed 
to 
refer 
to 
the 
swarms 
of 
insects: 
Kay 
explains 
(b)

In 
translating 
the 
Greek 
it 
would 
be 
possible 
to 
take 
Οὐαὶ 
γῆς 
together, 
see 
on 
i. 24: 
πλοίων 
πτέρυγες 
following 
as 
a 
can: 
pendent: 
‘Ah 
for 
the 
land, 
the 
sails 
of 
the ’: 
but 
it 
seems 
more 
probable 
that 
γῆς 
qualifies 
πλοίων, 
which 
is 
a 
mere 
guess. 
Lowth 
denies 
that 
the 
Heb. 
word 
for 
‘wings’ 
is 
ever 
used 
of 
the 
sails 
of 
ships: 
but 
so 
obvious 
a 
metaphorical 
use 
can 
hardly 
be 
called 
impossible, 
and 
Skinner 
mentions 
that 
the 
Targ. 
supports 
it. 
It 
may 
be 
noted 
that 
Lxx. 
have 
already 
twice 
in 
the 
book 
used 
πλοίων 
somewhat 
at 
random: 
namely, 
ii. 16, 
and 
xi. 14, 
where 
Heb. 
‘shoulder,’ 
 differs 
only 
by 
the 
middle 
letter 
from 
‘wing,’ 
which 
occurs 
just 
above.
ὅμηρα] 
The 
neuter 
form 
is 
used 
(in 
plur.) 
by 
Lysias 
and 
Polybius, 
and 
Liddell 
and 
Scott 
suggest 
that 
there

to 
be

being 
adjectival. 
Heb. 
generally 
interpreted

Heb.

several 
ancient 
writers

Cf.

Heb.

now 
generally 
rendered 
‘tall’ 
(lit. 
‘stretched 
out'). 
I 
cannot 
however 
ﬁnd 
that 
μετέωρος 
is 
used 
in 
this 
sense 
of 
men. 
Below, 
ver. 7, 
the 
same 
Heb. 
is 
a 
good 
deal 
more 
closely 
rendered. 
ξένον] 
Heb. 
‘smooth’ 
or 
‘polished,’ 
perhaps 
of 
the 
shining 
skins 
of 
the 
Ethiopians. 
ξένον, 
possibly 
a

of

The 
interrogative 
or 
read 
for

the 
literal 
Hebrew

‘since

onward.' 
Or 
the 
form 
of 
the 
pronoun 
in 
Exod. 
xvi. 15

have 
been 
thought 
to 
be 
here 
used.

but 
Lxx. 
here, 
as 
in 
xxviii. 
IO, 13, 
c., 
have 
connected 
it 
in 
meaning 
with 
mp, 
‘hope,’ 
‘expect.’ 
Vulg. 
also 
expectantem 
et 
conculcatam. 
Heb. 
is 
interpreted 
(i) 
of 
measuring 
out 
enemies 
for 
punishment 
or 
destruction, 
cf. 2 
Sam. 
viii. 2; 
(ii) 
of

e. 
imperious; 
(iii) 
(from 
another 
root) 
‘very

καταπεπατημένον] 
Heb. 
‘(of) 
treading 
down': 
LXX. 
and 
Vulg., 
like 
A.
V., 
have 
interpreted 
it 
passively.
νῦν 
οἱ 
ποταμοὶ 
τῆς 
γῆς] 
LXX. 
have 
apparently 
lost 
the 
clue, 
or 
come 
upon 
some 
illegible 
words. 
Ver. 7 
is 
differently 
attempted. 
The 
syntax 
forsakes 
the 
Heb. 
altogether.
ὡσεὶ

ἀρθῆ] 
Β* 26 91 97 104 106 147 309 
read 
ὡς 
εἷς, 
and 
have 
ἀρθήσεται, 
which 
looks 
as 
if 
it 
had 
been 
assimilated 
to 
the 
neighbouring 
tenses. 
The 
subjunctive 
is 
curious, 
but 
is 
probably 
to 
be 
translated 
as 
of 
an 
imaginary 
comparison: 
Jerome 
renders 
by 
sicut

Cf. 
the 
optativcs 
in 
xi. 9,

Ἀσφάλεια] 
Not 
used 
elsewhere 
to 
translate 
the 
present 
Heb., 
to 
which 
it 
is 
moderately 
near 
in 
meaning 
(syntax 
differs): 
the 
Heb. 
verb 
is 
elsewhere 
ἡσυχάσαι, 
vii. 4, 
πεποιθώς, 
xiv. 7 
(Cf. 
xxx. 15), 
ἀνήσω,

I: 
conversely 
ἀσφάλεια 
is 
used 
with 
diff. 
Heb., 
viii. 15, 
xxxiv. 15 
and 
cf. 
xli. 
The 
phrase 
ἀσφάλεια 
ἔσται 
may 
be 
due 
to 
uncertainty 
as 
to 
the 
person. 
The 
next 
phrase 
‘and 
I 
will 
behold' 
is 
not 
rendered 
by ’ 
Lxx. 
Possibly 
they 
took 
it 
(none) 
to 
come 
from 
‘be 
confident. 
instead 
of 
and 
lost 
one 
of 
two 
words 
which 
they 
regarded 
as 
similar 
in 
meaning. 
(These 
two 
roots 
are 
coupled 
in 
xxx. 
πόλει] 
Heb. 
'place'

'dwelling.
μεσημβρίας] 
Heb.

be

The 
Heb. 
has 
not 
this 
duplicated 
expression.
The 
ﬁgure 
changes 
abruptly 
in 
’s 
manner: 
and 
instead 
of 
the 
metaphor 
of 
pruning, 
we 
have 
the 
reality 
of 
the 
corpses, 
"Whose 
limbs

on 
the 
naked 
shore
Devouring 
dogs

Aeschylus

takes 
refuge 
in 
vagueness, 
perhaps 
not 
understanding 
the 
original. 
συναχθήσεται 
may 
however 
be 
due 
to 
reading

alone 
adds

variants 
among 
the 
cursives 
include 
τεθλιμμένου 
καὶ 
τεταπεινωμένου 49 239 306 (36 228 
nearly). 
This 
rendering 
is 
nearer 
than 
that 
given 
in 
ver. 2, 
to 
what 
was 
formerly 
thought 
the 
Heb. 
meaning: 
cf. 
Vulgate, 
‘divulso 
et 
dilacerato.' 
As 
to 
τεθλιμμένου 
we 
may 
conjecture 
that 
Lxx. 
here 
read 
for 
cf. 
xxviii. 10, 11, 
and 
ἂν 
μέρει] 
Heb. 
differs 
from 
vii. 18. 
Here 
μέρος 
seems 
to 
be 
used 
with 
some 
reference 
to 
division, 
whether 
of 
spoil 
or 
otherwise: 
cf. 
μερὶς 
above, 
xvii. 14, 
μεμιῶ 
σκῦλα, 
Exod. 
xv. 9, 
c. 
Yet 
we 
should 
scarcely 
have 
discovered 
this 
from 
the 
Greek 
alone: 
it 
almost 
suggests 
elementary 
lexical 
work 
on 
the 
’s 
part. 
Moreover, 
it 
leaves 
it 
uncertain 
whether 
Lxx. 
connected 
with 
‘take 
the 
spoil, 
as 
most 
authorities 
used 
to 
render 
it: 
see 
A.
V., 
and 
Vulg. 
diri. 
puerunt, 
or 
gave 
it 
the 
sense, 
now 
generally 
approved, 
of 
‘divide’ 
Delitzsch). 
For 
this 
meaning 
cf. 
Herod. 11. 108, 
αἱ 
διώρυχεσ...

With 
the 
prophecy 
of 
the 
offering 
of 
Ethiopia 
to 
God, 
though 
the 
precise 
meaning 
may 
be 
doubtful, 
it 
seems 
natural 
to 
compare 
Ps. 
lxviii. 31, 
and 
Zeph. 
iii. 10. 
It 
is 
at 
least 
worthy 
of 
remark, 
that 
the 
Copts 
and 
Abyssinians 
alone 
among 
African 
peoples 
have 
maintained 
at 
least 
a 
nominal 
Christianity 
in 
the 
midst 
of 
Mohammedans.

’s 
burden. 
Egypt 
is 
spoken 
of 
with 
more 
condemnation 
than 
Ethiopia, 
and 
with 
some 
contempt. 
Isaiah 
felt 
it 
an 
especial 
charge 
to 
preach 
against 
Egyptian 
influence 
on 
Judah, 
cf. 
chaps. 
xxx., 
xxxi. 
Yet 
there 
is 
an 
undercurrent 
of 
sympathy: 
and 
ver. 21 
(or 
even 
ver. 18) 
onward 
is 
in 
some 
ways 
an 
expanded 
parallel 
to 
xviii. 7. 
The 
teaching 
agrees 
with 
Deut. 
xvii. 16 
and 
xxiii. 
The 
date 
is 
uncertain, 
many 
times 
up 
to 
the 
Assyrian 
crisis 
being 
suggested. 
If 
that 
is 
placed 
in 701, 
that 
year 
and 720 
are 
perhaps 
the 
most 
favoured.

νομὸς 
ἐπὶ 
νομὸν] 
The 
Alexandrian 
translator 
shows 
his 
knowledge 
of 
Egypt. 
Herodotus 
uses 
this 
word 
of 
Egyptian 
divisions, 
II.— 166: 
κατὰ 
γὰρ 
δὴ 
νομοὺς· 
Αἴγυπτος· 
ἅπασα 
διαραίρηται. 
He 
uses 
it, 
however, 
of 
other 
countries, 
as 
in 
I. 192. 
The 
Ethiopian 
domination 
may 
have 
been 
assisted 
by 
this 
jealousy 
between 
the 
states.
Tyconius, 
whose 
Old 
Latin 
version 
mistook 
the 
word 
νομός, 
has 
lex 
supra 
legem: 
and 
some 
printed 
texts 
of 
LXX. 
accent 
the

wrongly.

Cf. 
Aesch.

So 
ℵA (22) 36 41 49 106: 
other 
MSS.

It 
agrees 
with 
the 
Heb. 
well 
enough, 
but 
is 
coupled 
with 
ἐγγαστριμύθους 
in 
I 
Sam. 
xxviii. 
ἀνθρώπων] 
Inserted 
by 
Lxx., 
perhaps 
to 
indicate 
that 
the 
following 
expression 
does 
not 
refer 
to 
God: 
it 
may 
be 
due 
to 
an 
early 
scribe.
κυρίων 
σκληρῶν] 
Heb. 
is 
plural, 
so 
called, 
of 
‘majesty’ 
(adj. 
in 
sing.). 
βασιλεῖς 
σκληραί, 
following, 
is 
sing. 
in 
Heb. 
with 
a 
different 
adjective, 
often 
meaning 
strong 
('rex 
fortis,' 
Vulg.); 
here 
probably 
‘harsh’ 
or 
'stem.
What 
is 
meant 
by 
the 
‘harsh 
lord' 
is 
very 
uncertain, 
whether 
a 
foreign 
oppressor 
or 
a 
king 
ruling 
over 
the 
country, 
by 
usurpation 
or 
otherwise. 
On 
the 
whole, 
the 
balance 
of 
opinion 
seems 
in 
favour 
of 
its 
being 
an 
Assyrian 
(Esarhaddon, 
who 
was 
not, 
however, 
for 
an 
Assyrian, 
a 
specially 
‘harsh 
lord,' 
or 
Assurbanipal); 
or 
an 
Ethiopian 
(Pianchi 
MerAmon, 
whose 
date 
is 
probably 
too 
early, 
or 
Tirhakah). 
Delitzsch 
supports 
the 
Egyptian 
Psammetichus: 
and 
many 
others, 
as 
Cambyses, 
have 
been 
suggested.
πίονται] 
Cf. 
Exod. 
vii. 24. 
Lxx. 
apparently 
read 
their 
verb 
from 
‘drink,’ 
instead 
of 
‘dry 
up' 
(xli. 17, 
Jer. 
Ii. 30?). 
The 
verb 
in 
the 
somewhat 
similar 
verse, 
Job 
xiv. 11, 
is 
different.
ἐκλείψουσιν] 
So 
Vulgate, 
‘deﬁcient’: 
now 
generally 
rendered 
‘shall 
stink': 
an 
exceptional 
verbform 
Cf. 
Exod. 
vii. 
αἱ 
διώρυγες 
τοῦ 
ποταμοῦ] 
Quite 
a 
correct 
description: 
the 
trenches 
dug 
from 
the 
Nile 
for 
irrigation 
are 
meant. 
Heb. 
uses 
the 
plural 
of 
the 
word 
regularly 
standing 
in 
sing. 
for 
the 
Nile 
itself: 
but 
this 
does 
not 
correspond 
in 
the 
order, 
the 
verb 
‘are 
emptied,' 
‘dwindle,’ 
standing 
here 
in 
Heb.
The 
neglect 
of 
the 
machinery 
for 
irrigation 
in 
times 
of 
misrule 
or 
political 
disorder, 
or 
a 
natural 
failure 
of 
the 
annual 
overflow 
of 
the 
Nile, 
produced 
disastrous 
results 
in 
Egypt, 
where 
the 
crops 
depended 
entirely 
on 
the 
river 
water, 
the 
rain 
being 
very 
scanty. 
See 
Herod. 
II. 19, 92, 108, 
ἃς.
πᾶσι 
συναγωγὴ 
ὔδατος] 
This 
phrase 
occurs 
in 
xxxvii. 25, 
where 
also 
Heb. 
has 
‘canals 
of 
Mazor.' 
πᾶσα 
however 
is 
superfluous 
here. 
The 
corresponding 
verse 
in 2 
Kings 
(xix. 24) 
has 
πάντας 
τοὺς 
ποτα· 
μοὺς 
περιοχῆς, 
which 
makes 
it 
look 
as 
if 
xxxvii. 25 
had 
been 
translated 
ﬁrst. 
Whether 
Lxx. 
made 
συναγωγὴ 
from 
some 
supposed 
meaning 
of 
(or 
or 
read 
some 
other 
word, 
such 
as 
 for 
(cf. 
Gen. 
i. 9), 
is 
hardly 
possible 
to 
say.
Mazor, 
a 
singular 
form 
of 
the 
dual 
name 
Mizraim, 
Egypt. 
Its 
literal 
meaning 
is 
probably 
‘wall’ 
or 
‘fortiﬁcation.’ 
According 
to 
Delitzsch 
and 
others, 
it 
stands 
especially 
for 
Lower 
Egypt, 
Pathros 
being 
Upper 
Egypt, 
and 
the 
two 
together 
Mizraim. 
Cf. 
‘the 
Two 
sicilies,' 
‘all 
the 
Russias,' 
and 
many 
plural 
names 
of 
countries 
and 
cities 
in 
various 
languages.

rest 
of 
the 
verse 
differs 
from 
Heb.
τὸ 
ἄχι] 
Cf. 
Gen. 
xli. 2, 18 
(and 19 
in 
Lxx.). 
The 
Hebrew 
here 
has 
‘meadows’ 
or 
‘open 
spaces': 
but 
in 
Genesis 
which 
is 
said 
to 
be 
an 
Egyptian 
word, 
of 
which 
ἅχι 
is 
a 
Greek 
form 
or 
corruption: 
meaning 
‘reeds’ 
or 
‘marshgrass.’ 
It 
is 
not 
impossible 
that 
Lxx. 
read 
here: 
but 
their 
rendering 
of 
this 
verse 
is 
not 
very 
close.
ἀνεμόφθορον] 
The 
Lxx. 
seem 
to 
have 
taken 
another 
hint 
from 
Gen. 
xli., 
where 
this 
word 
occurs 
ﬁve 
times, 
ver. 6, 7, 23, 24, 27; 
not 
in 
Heb. 
of 7 
and 24. 
Here 
Heb. 
has 
with 
τόδ’ 
ξηρανθήσεται) 
preceding: 
‘shall 
be 
driven 
away, 
and 
be 
no 
more': 
but 
Lxx. 
may 
have 
guessed 
at 
the 
Heb. 
word 
in 
Genesis, 
(or 
 of 
which 
the 
rootletters 
occur 
here 
in 
Isaiah 
in 
their 
proper 
order, 
taking 
the 
from 
the 
previous 
word.
βύσσον] 
Heb. 
‘white 
cloths,' 
perhaps 
cotton 
as 
well 
as 
linen. 
The 
local 
knowledge 
of 
the 
translator 
was 
probably 
equal 
to 
this 
rendering. 
(Gen. 
xli. 42 
has 
στολὴν 
βυσσίνην.) 
There 
is 
probably 
no 
reference 
in 
the 
original 
to 
nets 
or 
ﬁshing 
in 
this 
verse.
διαζόμενοι] 
Heb. 
probably 
‘pillars’ 
or 
‘foundations’ 
(Ps. 
xi. 3), 
but 
it 
has 
been 
very 
variously 
rendered, 
some 
supposing 
it 
to 
have 
to 
do 
with 
nets 
or 
weaving.
The 
LXX. 
reading 
is 
of 
interest. 
Most 
MSS., 
headed 
by 
ℵ*B, 
read 
ἐργαζόμενοι: 
AQ* 
have 
διαλογιζόμενοι, 
and 
διαζόμενοι 
is 
read 
by 
ℵcb(
vid) 26 49 106 301. 
The 
last 
is, 
I 
cannot 
but 
think, 
the 
true 
reading. 
(διάζεσθαι 
and 
δίασμα 
occur 
in 
A'
s 
text 
of 
Judges, 
xvi. 13, 14.) 
ἐργαζόμενοι 
is 
either 
an 
attempt 
to 
explain 
the 
less 
known 
word, 
or 
simply 
repeated 
by 
inadvertence 
from 
the 
previous 
verse: 
and 
διαλογιζόμενοι 
a 
guess 
by 
a 
scribe, 
who, 
not 
knowing 
διάζεσθαι, 
supposed 
the 
letters 
to 
have 
fallen 
out. 
(See 
note, 
Vol. 
I. 
Introd. 
p. 
ζῦθον] 
‘beer’: 
evidently 
LXX. 
read 
‘strong 
drink,’ 
for 
‘hire.’ 
Cf. 
vii. 20, 
xxviii. 1, 3. 
Some 
think 
the 
LXX. 
rendering 
to 
be 
right 
(e.
g. 
Prof. 
W. 
E. 
Barnes).
ψυχὰς] 
Heb. 
is 
singular. 
A. 
V. 
takes 
it 
collectively 
as 
living 
creatures, 
i.
e. 
in 
this 
connection 
‘fish.’ 
But 
the 
meaning 
of 
the 
verse 
is 
probably 
as 
in 
R. 
V.; 
the 
word 
redered 
‘grieved’ 
is 
identical 
in 
letters 
with 
‘pools’ 
or 
‘ponds’ 
in 
Heb. 
LXX. 
may 
have 
read 
it 
or 
regarded 
it 
as 
the 
same 
word 
as 
Job 
xxx. 
Τάνεως] 
Tanis 
is 
the 
Greek 
name 
of 
Zoan, 
an 
old 
and 
renowned 
city 
in 
the 
Delta. (30 
miles 
S.
W. 
of 
Port 
Said), 
and 
thus 
nearer 
than 
the 
other 
principal 
cities 
to 
the 
frontier 
of 
Judah 
(Numb. 
xiii. 22; 
Ps. 
lxxviii. 12). 
The 
capital 
of 
the 
Hyksos.
οἱ 
σοφοὶ 
σύμβουλοι] 
The 
casus 
pendens 
is 
according 
to 
the 
Hebrew.
The 
wise 
men 
of 
Egypt 
are 
challenged, 
like 
the 
magicians 
in 
Moses' 
day 
(Exod. 
vii. 11). 
So 
the 
idols 
are 
challenged 
in 
xli. 23, 
the 
astrologers, 
xlvii. 13; 
and 
any 
who 
profess 
to 
foretell 
or 
render 
void 
God'
s 
purpose 
(xliii. 9, 
xlv. 21, 
xlviii. 14, 
&amp;
c.).
ὑψώθησαν] 
Taking 
‘are 
deceived,’ 
from 
‘lift

instead 
of 
Μέμφεως] 
Heb. 
Noph 
(Moph 
in 
Hos. 
ix. 6). 
The 
capital 
of 
the 
early 
dynasties 
of 
Egypt, 
including 
the 
Pyramidbuilders. 
Psammetichus 
I. 
fixed 
the 
capital 
there 
again. 
Cairo 
is 
near 
the 
same 
site.
κατὰ 
φυλὰς] 
Heb. 
‘the 
corner 
of 
her 
tribes’: 
Scholz 
explains 
the 
discrepancy 
by 
referring 
to 
Exod. 
xxvii. 12, 
Levit. 
xiii. 41, 
where 
also = 
‘corner,’ 
which 
he 
thinks 
was 
read 
by 
LXX. 
here, 
is 
rendered 
κατά. 
There 
is, 
however, 
a 
preposition 
in 
each 
case. 
Perhaps 
LXX. 
read

πᾶς

φοβηθήσονται] 
The 
Heb. 
is 
variously 
rendered, 
but 
some, 
as 
A.
V., 
have 
taken 
it 
substantially 
as 
LXX.
A 
most 
difficult 
verse. 
The 
number 
of 
‘ﬁve 
cities' 
has 
never 
been 
explained, 
further 
than 
as 
a 
small, 
but 
appreciable, 
number, 
which 
shall, 
if 
Egyptian, 
be 
turned 
to 
the 
true 
God, 
or, 
if 
Jewish 
settlements, 
practise 
their 
religion 
in 
Egypt.
πάλη 
ἁσεδὲκ] 
In 
this 
phrase, 
and 
the 
corresponding 
Hebrew, 
lies 
a 
special 
difficulty. 
The 
Heb. 
text 
has 
(City 
of) 
haheres, 
i.
e. 
‘of 
destruction,' 
which 
seems 
inconsistent 
with 
the 
apparent 
meaning 
of 
the 
verse. 
Some 
explain 
it 
from 
Arabic 
haris, 
as 
‘of 
the 
Lion. 
referring 
it 
to 
the 
temple 
built 
at 
Leontopolis 
by 
Onias 
IV., 
of 
the 
high 
priestly 
line, 
for 
the 
Jewish 
exiles 
in 
Egypt. 
Others, 
again, 
reading 
with 
some 
MSS. 
for 
read 
haheres, 
‘of 
the 
sun' 
(civitas 
solis, 
Vulg.), 
meaning 
HeliOpolis, 
or 
On, 
where 
was 
an 
important 
college 
of 
Egyptian 
priests. 
The 
Lxx. 
reading 
seems 
to 
have 
been 
hatzedek, 
‘of 
righteousness,' 
quite 
unlike 
the 
Heb. 
(though 
see 
below), 
but 
giving 
an 
easier 
general 
sense. 
With 
these 
data, 
Cheyne 
suggested 
that 
the 
original 
text 
was 
heres, 
referring 
to 
HeliOpolis: 
which 
might 
have 
been 
altered 
by 
Jews 
in 
Egypt 
to 
tzedek, 
in 
support 
of 
the 
Leontopolis 
temple, 
by 
others 
to 
heres, 
‘destruction,’ 
in 
condemnation 
of 
it. 
This, 
however, 
is 
somewhat 
complicated; 
and 
Bp 
’s 
sturdy 
comment 
is 
worth 
recalling: 
“After 
all, 
I 
believe, 
that 
neither 
Onias, 
nor 
Heliopolis, 
nor 
Leontopolis, 
has 
anything 
to 
do 
with 
this 
subject" 
and 
Prof. 
Skinner, 
whose 
note 
should 
be 
carefully 
consulted, 
draws 
attention 
to 
the 
fact, 
that, 
according 
to 
Josephus, 
it 
was 
not 
this, 
but 
the 
next 
verse, 
to 
which 
Onias 
referred. 
(Aquila 
and 
Theodotion 
have 
αρες, 
Symmachus 
ἡλίου.)
So 
far 
there 
is 
little 
satisfaction. 
More 
recently, 
however, 
Mr 
F. 
C. 
Burkitt 
has 
pointed 
out 
that 
the 
reading 
of ℵ*, 
ασεδ 
ἡλίου 
καί, 
admits 
another 
explanation. 
ἡλίου 
is 
clearly 
a 
duplicate.) 
He 
therefore 
proposes 
to 
read 
ασεδ 
in 
Lxx., 
and 
in 
the 
Heb. 
‘mercy,’ 
'lovingkindness,' 
for 
This 
gives 
as 
easy 
a 
sense 
as 
anything 
yet 
before 
us, 
and 
brings 
the 
mat. 
and 
Heb. 
into 
agreement. 
The 
brilliance 
of 
the 
emendation 
cannot 
be 
denied: 
if 
not 
certain, 
it 
is 
better 
than 
many 
emendations 
which 
are 
called 
so. 
It 
is 
accepted 
by 
Prof. 
W. 
E. 
Barnes 
in 
his 
recent 
edition 
of 
Isaiah 
(The 
Churchman'
s 
Bible).
Attention 
has 
already 
(note 
on 
iii. 10) 
been 
drawn 
to 
the 
numerous 
verbal 
resemblances 
between 
the 
Book 
of 
Wisdom 
and 
the 
Greek 
Isaiah. 
It 
is 
at 
any 
rate 
an 
odd 
coincidence 
that 
brings 
together, 
in 
Wisd. 
x. 6, 7, 
the 
words 
Πενταπόλεως 
and 
στήλη. 
Several 
other 
words  
 used 
in 
Isaiah 
occur 
in 
the 
chapter: 
χέρσος, 
μνημόσυνον 
(Isa. 
xxiii. 18), 
ἀσφαλίσασθαι 
(xli. 10), 
λάκκος 
(xxxvii. 16, 
not 
B), 
εὐσέβεια 
(xi. 2), 
τρανός 
(xxxv. 
στήλη] 
Whether 
an 
actual 
obelisk 
is 
meant 
or 
not, 
the 
idea 
of 
a 
prominent 
landmark 
as 
a 
memorial 
is 
easy 
to 
understand, 
in 
Egypt 
of 
all 
countries. 
It 
is 
to 
be 
a 
sign 
and 
witness, 
like 
Bethe 
or 
Mizpah. 
Any 
reference 
to 
the 
‘pillars’ 
of 
Canaanite 
idolatry, 
as 
in 
xvii. 8, 
seems 
ﬂatly 
impossible 
here.

refer 
this 
primarily 
to

Ptolemies,

him

Soter. 
The 
language, 
however, 
is 
like 
that 
of 
various 
Messianic 
references. 
And 
Egypt 
has 
undoubtedly 
received 
many 
blessings 
from 
Christianity. 
After 
so 
many 
centuries, 
her 
state 
today 
is 
happier 
than 
many 
lands: 
perhaps 
than 
any 
other 
part 
of 
Africa.

the

with 
this 
insertion.

certainly 
‘serve

the 
Assyrians': 
Lxx. 
took

as 
the 
sign 
of 
the 
object. 
Prof. 
Cheyne 
thinks 
this 
rendering, 
with 
which 
the 
Vulgate 
agrees, 
“thoughtless”: 
but 
if 
the 
‘cruel 
lord' 
of 
ver. 4 
was, 
as 
many, 
himself 
included, 
have 
thought, 
an 
Assyrian 
king, 
it 
is 
not 
altogether 
unnatural. 
See 
also 
ch. 
xx. 
mm. 
omit 
‘the 
work 
of 
my 
hands': 
perhaps 
they 
took 
it 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
idols, 
and 
did 
not 
perceive 
its 
relevance.
Prof. 
Barnes 
remarks 
that 
this, 
like 
xi. 6 
foll., 
is 
a 
vision 
of 
a 
golden 
age. 
“The 
two 
ancient

and 
Israel, 
whose

was 
so

‘a

with 
them'.

B 
omits 
these 
words 
after 
ἡττηθέντες: 
at 
their 
second 
occurrence 
the 
Heb. 
has 
a 
preposition 
(lit. 
‘from’) 
preceding. 
The 
Lxx. 
have 
lost 
the 
syntax 
and 
with 
it 
the 
meaning.
ἦσαν 
γὰρ] 
Β 
reads 
οἱ 
ἦσαν, 
with 
the 
Lucianic 
MSS. 
generally.
Ἰδοὺ] 
Β 
precedes, 
in 
agreement 
with 
the 
Heb., 
with 
ἐν

which 
is 
apparently 
a 
Hexaplaric 
addition (*

The 
syntax 
again 
varies: 
the 
negative 
in 
LXX 
may 
come 
from 
before 
the 
infinitive: 
but 
the 
rendering 
is 
wrong 
as 
well 
as 
loose ; 
cf. 
with 
the 
Greek 
xlvi. 
XXI. 1. 
Lxx. 
omit 
‘of 
the 
sea' 
in 
the 
title 
of 
the 
prophecy: 
and 
use 
ἕρημος 
both 
for 
midbar, 
‘wilderness’ 
or 
‘desert,’ 
and 
for 
Negeb  
 ('dry'), 
translated 
‘south’ 
in 
A.
V., 
a 
terraced 
plateau 
Sward 
from 
Beersheba. 
(The 
variations 
between 
θάλασσαν 
and 
ἔρημον, 
xvi. 8 
θαλάσσης 
and 
γῆς, 
lxiii. 11. 
are 
curious.)
Delitzsch'
s 
note 
should 
be 
consulted: 
he 
applies 
the 
title 
to 
the 
sealike 
desert 
surrounding 
Babylon, 
which 
was 
moreover 
subject 
to 
inundation : 
and 
called 
the 
‘sealand’ 
by 
the 
monuments. 
So 
Herod. 1, 184, 
πρότερον 
δὲ 
ἐώθεε 
ὁ 
ποταμὸς 
ἀνὰ 
τὸ 
πεδίον 
πᾶν 
πελαγίζειν. 
Some 
modern 
critics, 
however, 
deny 
authority 
to 
this 
and 
similar 
titles. 
Opinions 
differ, 
but 
most 
commentators 
refer 
this 
chapter 
to 
the 
fall 
of 
Babylon 
when 
taken 
by 
Cyrus : 
some 
to 
an 
earlier 
siege 
in 
Isaiah'
s 
own 
time. 
Of 
those 
who 
refer 
it 
to 
the 
time 
of 
Cyrus, 
many, 
denying 
that 
prophecy 
may 
be 
expected 
to 
see 
into 
the 
far 
future 
in 
detail, 
attribute 
it 
to 
a 
later 
prophet 
about 540 
B.
C. 
Those 
who 
do 
not 
seek 
to 
impose 
such 
limits, 
will 
hardly 
doubt 
Isaiah'
s 
authorship.
Ὡς...
διέλθοι] 
For 
διέλθοι 
Q* 
has 
merely 
θοι. 
The 
clause 
must 
be 
comparative, 
see 
on 
xi. 9, 
xviii. 3. 
It 
seems 
probable 
that 
the 
Optative 
might 
be 
used 
where, 
as 
here, 
Heb. 
has 
infin. 
with 
with 
a 
kind 
of 
gerundial 
force. 
The 
only 
other 
way 
to 
take 
the 
Greek 
would 
be 
as 
Oratio 
Obliqua, 
depending 
on 
ἀνηγγέλη: 
and 
the 
meaning 
of 
Heb., 
and 
practice 
of 
the 
Lxx., 
seem 
decisive 
against 
this. 
Jerome 
renders 
the 
Greek 
sicut...
transeat. 
φοβερὸν 
is 
clearly 
a 
departure 
from 
the 
syntax 
of 
Heb.
ὁ 
ἀθετῶν 
ἀθετεῖ] 
Cf. 
xxiv. 16, 
xxxiii. 1, 
xlviii. 8; 
the 
root 
always 
emphatically 
repeated, 
and 
with 
the 
same 
parallel 
verb 
in 
xxxiii. 1. 
Kay 
explains 
the 
Heb. 
(rendered 
‘deal 
treacherously’ 
or 
thus: 
“the 
faithless 
or 
unscrupulous 
man, 
who 
sets 
at 
nought 
the 
restraints 
of 
law, 
or 
the 
engagements 
he 
has 
himself 
made.'
ὁ 
ἀνομῶν

Lxx. 
seem 
here 
to 
have 
chosen 
a 
word 
of 
parallel 
sound 
to 
the 
preceding 
clause, 
at 
the 
cost 
of 
exactness. 
Heb. 
‘the 
spoiler 
spoileth' 
or 
‘destroyer 
destroyeth.' 
In 
xxxiii. 1, 
ταλαιπωρεῖν 
is 
used, 
transitively.
Without 
implicitly 
following 
what 
is 
laid 
down 
by 
Dr 
Hatch 
(Essay: 
in 
Bibl. 
Greek, 
pp. 22, 30, 
c.) 
it 
may 
be 
said 
that 
Lxx. 
do 
not 
always 
preserve 
accurate 
distinctions 
among 
groups 
of 
words 
with 
somewhat 
similar 
meanings.

by 
Lxx. 
as

instead 
of 
imper. 
of

‘Go

Even 
if 
we 
could 
take 
their 
rendering 
as 
equivalent 
to 
a 
battle 
cry, 
Α 
moi! 
the 
parallelism 
is 
against 
it. 
Moreover, 
Lxx. 
elsewhere 
read 
wrongly 
‘I 
pray' 
as 
ἐν

quite 
against 
the 
sense: 
Judg.

Heb. 
‘I

Lxx. 
may 
have 
attempted 
a 
paraphrase, 
or 
possibly 
taken 
from 
in 
sense 
of 
‘refresh,’ 
‘restore.’ 
παρακαλέω 
is 
a 
favourite 
word 
with 
the 
mat. 
in 
Isaiah, 
to 
use 
in 
cases 
of 
doubt 
or 
difficulty: 
cf. 
x. 32, 
xxxviii. 16. 
(See 
Vol. 1. 
lntrod. 
p. 
ἠδίκησα] 
Heb. 
is 
passive 
or 
ﬂexive 
(Niphal) : 
word 
meaning 
‘to

‘bent,’ 
so 
in 
active, 
‘to 
do 
wrong.' 
('Perverse,

For

and 
the 
Roman 
edition 
has 
it 
also

The 
negatives 
evidently 
represent 
the 
Heb. 
‘from,’ 
taken 
as 
having 
privative 
force.
ἐσπούδασα] 
Heb. 
is 
again 
passive, 
as 
ἠδίκησα 
above: 
word 
meaning 
‘be 
terrified,' 
‘cast 
down,' 
and 
in 
causal 
voice 
or 
aspect 
to 
‘hasten.’
ἡ 
ἀνομία 
με 
βαπτίζει] 
Heb. 
‘horror 
affrights 
me.' 
The 
Lxx. 
here 
reminds 
us 
of 
P5. 
xxxviii. 4, 6, 
lxix. 2, 
but 
bears 
no 
resemblance 
to 
the 
Heb. 
They 
may 
possibly 
have 
read 
for 
 ‘breaking 
down,' 
the 
verb 
applied 
to 
overflowing 
of 
water, 
and 
to 
lawlessness: 
cf. 1 
Sam. 
xxv. 10, 
‘that 
break 
away 
every 
man 
from 
his 
master': 
Lxx. 
represents 
Perazim, 
xxviii. 21, 
by 
ἀσεβῶν). 
For 
perhaps 
they 
read 
but 
the 
letters 
are 
not 
very 
near: 
had 
they 
read 
any 
part 
of 
καταπίνω 
would 
probably 
have 
been 
their 
word.
ἢ 
ἡ 
ψυχή] 
Clearly 
due 
to 
reading 
for 
‘twilight’: 
Lxx. 
omit 
‘of 
my 
desire,' 
perhaps 
because 
bears 
something 
of 
the 
same 
meaning: 
cf. 
e.
g. 
lvi. 
τράπεζαν] 
After 
this 
Heb. 
has 
‘they 
set 
the 
watch' 
(or 
acc. 
to 
some, 
‘they 
spread 
the 
carpets.' 
Lxx. 
omits 
this, 
but 
it 
was 
apparently 
supplied 
in 
the 
Hexapla 
and 
σκόπευσαν 
τὴν 
σκοπιὰν 
is 
found 
in 22 23 48 51 90 109 144 305 308 
(Q 
mg 
with *). 
The 
Heb. 
verbs 
are 
infin 
absolute, 
which 
may 
be 
taken 
as 
equivalent 
to 
the 
imperative, 
or 
better, 
to 
a 
descriptive 
tense.
πίστι, 
φάγετε] 
So 
RAQ, 
with 
Heb.: 
B 
inverts 
the 
order.
ἑτοιμάσατε 
θυρεοὺς] 
Verb 
is 
an 
explanatory 
version 
of 
Heb., 
which 
has 
‘anoint 
the ’ 
(that 
blows 
might 
glance 
at? 
it). 
So 
Virg. 
Aen 
VII. 626, 
“Pars 
leves 
clipeos 
et 
spicula 
lucida 
tergent 
Arvina 
pingui.'
The 
relation 
of 
the 
prophet 
to 
the 
‘watchman’ 
is 
interesting. 
Generally, 
the 
prophet 
is 
himself 
the 
watchman : 
as 
perhaps 
in 
ver. 11 
(diff. 
Heb. 
word), 
and 
clearly 
in 
Ezek. 
iii. 17, 
xxxiii. 7, 
Habak. 
ii. 
I. 
The 
best 
view 
seems 
to 
be 
that 
of 
Delitzsch, 
that 
the 
prophet 
“divides 
himself 
into 
two ” : 
seeing, 
and 
yet 
not 
himself 
directly 
seeing 
the 
vivid 
scene 
of 
the 
next 
verse. 
He 
plays 
both 
parts, 
as 
in 2 
Sam. 
xviii. 24, 
the 
watcher 
on 
the 
tower, 
and 
also 
the 
bearer 
below, 
making 
his 
comments.
σεαυτῷ] 
'Go,' 
which 
may 
have 
been 
read 
in 
duplicate, 
the 
second 
time 
as 
‘for

Most 
authorities 
(as 
Ewald, 
Kay, 
Driver, 
Skinner, 
W. 
E. 
Barnes), 
but 
not 
Cheyne, 
translate 
the 
Heb. 
‘And 
if 
(or, 
when) 
he 
see...
let 
him 
hearken...' 
rather 
than 
‘And

part 
of 
the 
command.

already 
abandons 
the 
distinction 
between 
prophet 
and 
watchman,

indeed 
in 
the 
previous 
clause 
ὃ 
ἂν 
ἴδῃς 
ἀνάγγειλον.
ἀναβάτας...
ἀναβάτην] 
Heb. 
is 
said 
to 
mean 
here 
‘a 
troop,' 
more 
probably 
than 
as 
AV. 
‘a 
chariot': 
but 
the 
word 
often 
means 
'rider' 
so 
Vulg. 
ascensorem. 
In 
the 
vision, 
bands 
and 
bodies 
of 
men, 
variously 
equipped, 
make 
their 
way 
across 
the 
plain.
ἀκρόασαι 
ἀκρόασιν 
πολλὴν] 
Heb. 
repeats 
the 
rootword 
thrice: 
‘hearken 
with 
hearkening, 
a 
great 
hearkening.
καὶ. 
κάλεσον 
Οὐρείαν] 
Heb. 
‘and 
he 
cried 
(called) 
as 
a 
lion' 
cf. 
Rev. 
x. 3. 
No 
more 
probable 
rendering 
is 
forthcoming. 
Arieh. 
‘a 
lion,' 
differs 
from 
Uriah 
only 
in 
vowelpoints, 
and 
the 
insertion 
of 
a 
after 
initial ℵ : 
which 
also 
might 
have 
been 
expressed 
in 
vowelpoints. 
The 
translator 
probably 
thought 
of 
viii. 
Aquila 
has 
λέοντα, 
Symm. 
λέαιναν, 
Vulg. 
leo, 
Theod. 
ἀριήλ, 
which 
Prof. 
W. 
E. 
Barnes 
revives.
If 
the 
prophecy 
be 
Isaiah'
s, 
Uriah'
s 
presence 
as 
a 
witness 
would 
not 
be 
in 
itself 
impossible: 
but 
it 
cannot 
be 
said 
that 
that 
reading 
would 
make 
the 
sentence 
much 
easier.
εἰς

So 
ℵAQΓ 26 41 49 90 91 97 106 198 228 233 301 306 308. 
B 
and 
the

MSS. 
(e

have 
a 
stop 
after 
σκοπιάν, 
followed 
by 
Κύριος 
εἶπεν, 
which 
hardly 
gives 
a 
probable 
sense. 
In 
any 
case, 
the

of 
the 
Heb. 
is 
lost.

the

Heb.

this

repeated : 
but 
B

alone,

nearly 50, 
among 
the 
Gk 
MSS.

In

doubled,

in

however, 
including 
C

(not 
the

not 
contain

Apart 
from 
the 
questions 
of 
the 
date 
and 
authorship 
of 
ver. 1—10, 
it 
is 
a 
doubtful 
point 
among 
commentators 
whether 
the 
following 
verses 
contain 
companion 
prophecies 
to 
the 
ﬁrst. 
In 
themselves 
they 
are 
hardly 
supposed 
to 
contain 
any 
clear 
indication 
of 
their 
date 
or 
occasion.
τῆς 
Ἰδουμαίας] 
Heb. 
Dumah, 
‘silence,’ 
usually 
interpreted 
as 
standing 
for 
Edom. 
The 
resemblance 
of 
the 
Greek 
word 
must 
be 
regarded 
as 
a 
coincidence, 
in 
the 
present 
state 
of 
our 
knowledge, 
though 
the 
interpretation 
stands 
as 
correct.
Dumah 
appears 
in 
Gen. 
xxv. 14 
as 
a

of

be 
different;

Γ 
has

ℵΒQ'

seems 
preferable, 
and 
agrees 
with 
Heb. 
The 
person 
endings 
often 
differ 
in 
the 
MSS., 
and 
somewhat 
markedly 
in 
the 
case 
of 
this 
verb:

The

is 
quite 
different 
from 
Heb., 
which 
has 
here 
a

not 
the

as 
in

connected 
with 
that

the

Delitzsch

Delitzsch

The 
subject

obscure. 
Possibly 
tribes 
originally 
of 
Ishmaelite

of 
Keturaite 
descent 
coalesced 
with 
Hamitic 
stocks ; 
and 
may 
also 
have

of

“Sept.

lucid 
but 
very 
different," 
Prof. 
Cheyne 
says. 
The 
syntax 
differs; 
the 
repeated 
διὰ 
τὸ

is 
apparently 
an 
attempt 
to  
 explain 
and 
enforce 
the 
Heb. 
‘from 
the 
face 
of,' 
and 
so 
almost= 
‘because 
of,' 
followed 
twice 
by 
‘sword,’ 
which 
may 
have 
been 
misread 
as 31, 
‘multitude,’ 
or 
(in 
plur.) 
as 
‘abundance.’ 
The 
ﬁrst 
clause 
in 
the 
Lxx. 
seems 
to 
come 
from 
the 
verb 
‘they 
ﬂed’ 
of 
Heb. : 
φευγόντων 
of

seems 
therefore 
preferable 
to 
πεφονευμένων

B, 
and 
the 
next 
clause 
with 
πλανωμένων 
is 
possibly 
a 
duplicate: 
the 
second 
clause 
relating 
to 
the 
‘drawn 
sword' 
is 
dropped 
in 
Lxx.: 
the 
next 
agrees 
with 
Heb., 
and 
the 
last 
must 
be 
a 
misreading 
or 
misunderstanding 
of 
‘weight.’

XXII. 1—14. 
The 
exact 
occasion 
of 
this 
prophecy 
is 
and 
its 
date 
also. 
Many 
place 
it 
in 701, 
some

it 
seems 
to 
refer 
to 
some 
relief 
of 
the

this

πλανῶνται,

ἕως

The 
verb 
is 
supplied 
before 
as 
well 
as 
after 
this 
phrase, 
which 
is 
peculiar 
here. 
Mr 
H. 
St 
J. 
Thackeray 
has 
pointed 
out 
(joum 
of 
Thai. 
Studies, 
July 1903, 
p. 583 
n.) 
that 
μικρὸς 
καὶ 
μέγας 
is 
“a 
characteristic 
phrase 
of 
the 
Isaiah 
translator.... 
He 
seems 
to 
have, 
recourse 
to 
this 
when 
in 
doubt 
as 
to 
the 
meaning 
of 
the 
Hebrew.” 
He 
refers 
to 
ix. 14., 
the 
present 
passage, 
and 
ver. 
below, 
and 
xxxiii. 4, 
The 
Heb. 
here 
is 
certainly 
obscure, 
and 
at 
the 
same 
time 
a 
phrase 
of 
marked 
appearance, 
It 
is 
generally 
rendered 
‘digging 
down 
the ’: 
but 
some 
render 
it 
‘Kir ’ 
making 
proper 
names 
of 
and 
also 
of 
which 
follows; 
‘and 
Shoa 
(is) 
at 
the ’ : 
see 
Ezek. 
xxiii. 23. 
This 
Heb. 
may 
have 
confused 
the 
translators, 
cf. 
xvii. 2, 
xxviii. 
Io; 
Vulg. 
has 
Cyrene, 2 
K. 
xvi. 9, 
Amos 
i. 5 
ix. 7 ; 
elsewhere 
‘wall,’ 
but 
it 
is 
not 
like 
after 
the 
ﬁrst 
two 
letters. 
Lxx. 
have 
not 
understood 
’r 
below, 
ver. 6, 
nor 
recognised 
it 
as 
a 
proper 
name 
anywhere 
in 
the 
O.
T., 
except 
Κυρήνηνδε, 
in 
A, 2 
Kings 
xvi. 
πλανῶνται] 
Another 
favourite 
word 
of 
the 
translator: 
see 
on 
xxi.  
and 
xxx. 20, 
lxiv. 5. 
Here, 
however, 
it 
seems 
simply 
due 
to 
LXX 
having 
read ’ 
(cf. 
xxviii. 7); 
perhaps 
an 
error 
of 
sound, 
or 
partly 
so.
ἀναβάται] 
Cf.

συναγωγή] 
Perhaps 
q) 
for 
Hip 
Kir: 
the 
Greek 
word 
sometimes 
represents 
but 
this 
is 
not 
very 
near.
παρατάξεως] 
Lxx. 
read 
‘order,’ 
‘arrangement,’ 
for 
mu, 
‘made ’: 
the 
verb 
three 
times 
in 2 
Sam. 
x. 8—10, 
παρετάξαντο. 
is 
omitted 
by 
Lxx.; 
perhaps 
considered 
to 
be 
implied.
Elam 
(xxi. 2) 
in 
the 
S.
E. 
of 
Assyrian 
Empire 
(Susiana); 
kir 
has 
not 
been 
satisfactorily 
identified, 
but 
was 
probably 
on 
the 
Tigris, 
within 
the 
Assyrian 
Empire.
ἔσονται] 
ἔσται 
would 
have 
corresponded 
with 
Heb.: 
but 
the 
verb 
was 
probably 
made 
plural, 
because 
of 
φάραγγες 
immediately 
following.
άνακαλύψουσιν] 
Lxx. 
continues 
the 
plural, 
and 
the 
fut. 
tense, 
losing 
the 
effect 
of 
Heb., 
which 
has 
sing. 
and 
impf. 
with 
υαυ 
conversive, 
indicating 
somewhat 
of 
a 
transition 
here.
πύλας] 
Possibly 
an 
explanation 
of 
Heb. 
‘covering,’ 
or 
‘curtain’ ’ 
as 
of 
a 
fortress, 
but 
see 
below.
ἐκλακτοὺς 
οἴκους] 
Heb. 
corresponding 
to 
ἐκλεκτοὺς 
is 
‘weapons. 
Lxx. 
may 
have 
misread 
or 
not 
known 
the 
word. 
Somewhat 
resembling 
it 
is 
the 
form 
nzciz, 
used 
in 
Nehemiah 
(xiii. 7, 
C.); 
the 
last 
consonant 
of 
the 
root 
differs, 
but 
the 
difference 
is 
perhaps 
not 
beyond 
the 
possibility 
of 
confusion. 
This 
word 
stands 
for 
a 
chamber 
attached 
to 
the 
Temple.
τῆς 
πόλεως] 
i.
e. 
‘City’ 
for 
‘forest.’ 
The 
‘house 
of 
the 
forest 
’is 
probably 
the 
‘house 
house 
of 
the 
forest 
of ’ 
built 
by 
Solomon, 
and 
used 
as 
an 
armoury : 
see

xxxix. 2, 1 
Kings 
vii. 2, 
x. 17, 
and

ἀνακαλύψουσιν] 
in 
the 
Heb., 
the 
verb 
of 
which 
comes 
later, 
and 
is 
represented 
by 
εἴδοσαν. 
It 
may 
be 
simply 
repeated 
from 
ver. 8; 
but 
it 
is 
suspicious 
that 
three 
words, 
πύλας, 
ἐκλεκτοὺς, 
ἀνακαλύψουσιν, 
each 
unwarranted 
by 
the 
Hebrew, 
are 
found 
rightly 
used 
just 
above 
at 
this 
point. 
It 
looks 
as 
if 
the 
’s 
or 
a 
’s 
eye 
had 
repeatedly 
strayed 
backward 
at 
some 
stage 
in 
the 
history 
of 
the 
text, 
or 
the

been 
disordered.

Field 
and 
Ceriani 
agree 
in 
approving 
the 
text 
as 
given 
by 
Q, 
with 
which 
the 
Syrohexaplar 
agrees: 
thinking 
that 
the 
fuller 
reading, 
which 
duplicates 
the 
reading 
of 
Q 
in 
verbal 
accordance 
with 
Aq. 
Theod. 
Symm. 
and 
with 
the 
Hebrew, 
is 
Hexaplaric. 
(See 
Vol. 1. 
Introd. 
p. 31.) 
Β'
s 
last 
clause 
is 
pretty 
clearly 
inconsistent 
with 
the 
rest 
of 
its 
reading, 
and 
points 
to 
some 
confusion 
or 
inadvertence 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
scribe, 
who 
seems 
to 
have 
had 
both 
readings 
before 
him. ℵ 
has 
been 
repeatedly 
corrected: 
its 
original 
text 
agrees 
very 
nearly 
with 
the 
Heb. 
A 
combines, 
practically, 
the 
readings 
of 
Q 
and 
of ℵ*. 
The 
evidence 
of 
the 
Syrohexaplar, 
and 
the 
intrinsic 
character 
of 
’s 
text, 
a 
terse 
paraphrase, 
makes 
it 
almost 
certain 
that 
the 
view 
of 
Field 
and 
Ceriani 
is 
right. 
’s 
view, 
that 
the 
sentence 
as 
given 
by 
Q 
is 
an 
“Unrichtige 
Erklarung 
des 
F 
Folgenden,” 
seems 
not 
to 
due 
account 
of 
the 
textual 
problem 
of 
the 
LXX.)

further

not 
made 
from

all.
στήσω] 
Β

have 
στηλῶ. 
The 
present 
Heb.

again, 
ver. 25, 
ἐστηριγμένος) 
is 
represented 
by 
στῆσαι

in 45

ἔσται 
πεποιθὼς] 
The 
explanatory 
method 
prevails 
through 
this 
verse, 
and 
to 
some 
extent 
in 
ver. 25 
also. 
On

on

The 
usual 
sense 
is 
rather 
‘overhang’ 
than 
‘hang 
upon.’
The 
difficulty 
in 
this 
verse 
is 
well 
known, 
whether 
it 
is 
to 
be 
taken 
as 
returning 
to 
the 
subject 
of 
Shebna, 
or 
foretelling 
the 
turn 
of 
Eliakim 
to 
fall 
also. 
On 
the 
whole, 
probably 
the 
latter :

this

Toapply 
the 
simile 
of 
the 
peg 
ﬁrst 
to 
Eliakim, 
then 
to 
Shebna, 
would 
be 
strange.
(c) 
To 
return 
for 
one 
verse 
to 8., 
without 
naming 
him, 
seems 
unnatural.
(d) 
Eliakim 
may 
have 
been 
personally 
faulty, 
and 
his 
relatives 
also, 
for 
anything 
that 
is 
said.
Lowth, 
Gesenius, 
Ewald, 
and 
W. 
E. 
Barnes 
refer 
the 
verse, 
however, 
to 
Shebna:

to 
Eliakim;

But 
here 
and 
in 
Ezek. 
xxvii. 12 
xxxviii. 13, 
LXX. 
renders 
by 
Καρχηδών, 
Καρχηδόνιοι. 
Authorities 
generally 
agree 
that 
Tarshish 
is 
Tartessus, 
in 
Spain. 
(See 
Herod. 1. 163, 
IV. 152, 192 ; 
the 
meaning 
of 
ἀκήρατον 
is 
unfortunately 
doubtful 
in 
W. 152.) 
Kay 
refers 
to 
Humboldt, 
Cosmos, 11. 
pp. 167, 413. 
It 
might 
be 
thought 
that 
the 1.101. 
tradition 
was 
entitled 
to 
carry 
weight, 
and 
the 
importance 
of 
Carthage 
(though 
this 
is 
a 
doubleedged 
argument) 
in 
commerce 
tallies 
with 
that 
which 
the 
Bible 
attributes 
to 
Tarshish. 
But 
from 
Ezek. 
xxvii. 
it 
appears 
that 
Lxx. 
speak 
without 
certainty 
on 
the 
point; 
in 
Isaiah 
we 
have 
such 
an 
anachronism 
as 
τὰ 
διαφανῆ 
Λακωνικά, 
iii. 16, 
and 
such 
a 
guess 
as 
Περσῶν, 
xlix. 12. 
Cf. 
Καππαδοκία 
for 
Caphtor, 
Deut. 
ii. 23, 
Amos 
ix. 7. 
(In 
Song 
of 
Sol. 
v. 13, 
where 
Lxx. 
has 
the 
usual 
Θαρσεῖς, 
it 
is 
generally 
supposed 
that 
is 
not 
a 
proper 
name, 
but 
stands 
for 
some 
gem, 
perhaps 
topaz.) 
As 
against 
the 
claims 
of 
Carthage, 
moreover, 
is 
the 
date 
of 
its 
foundation, 
which 
is 
not 
placed 
earlier 
than 
the 
ninth 
century 
B.
C., 
so 
that 
it 
could 
not 
have 
been 
the 
Tarshish 
of 
’s 
day, 
to 
say 
nothing 
of 
Gen. 
x. 4. 
The 
implied 
distance 
of 
the 
voyage 
is 
also, 
if 
anything, 
in 
favour 
of 
Spain. 
The 
phrase 
‘Ships 
of 
Tarshish,’ 
it 
is 
thought, 
like 
‘Indiamen, 
is 
sometimes 
used 
in 
a 
general 
sense 
for 
‘seagoing ’

spelling,

It

agreed 
that

Chittim 
is 
Cyprus 
(Citium, 
a 
Phoenician 
tradingport 
on 
the 
S. 
side 
of 
the 
island).
According 
to 
the 
Heb., 
the 
ships, 
on 
arrival 
at 
Cyprus, 
or 
before 
touching 
there, 
learn 
the 
news 
of 
a 
disaster 
to 
Tyre: 
which 
is 
variously 
explained 
as 
its 
overthrow 
by 
N 
ebuchadnezzar, 
or 
an 
earlier 
siege 
by 
Shalmaneser 
or 
by 
Sennacherib, 
who 
appears 
to 
have 
ravaged 
Phoenicia 
so 
that 
the 
king 
of 
Zidon 
ﬂed 
to 
Cyprus

In 
the 
plur. 
it 
is 
said 
to 
be 
used 
of 
‘habitable ’ 
‘coasts.’ 
and 
many 
render 
it 
‘country’ 
or 
‘coastland’ 
in 
the 
singular, 
as 
here 
and 
xx. 6. 
I 
cannot 
see 
any 
real 
distinction 
of 
sense 
in 
the 
way 
that 
the 
sing. 
and 
plur. 
are 
used. 
There 
seems 
at 
least 
to 
be, 
in 
general, 
an 
implication 
that 
the 
lands 
are 
detached, 
separate, 
and 
maritime ; 
and 
as 
LXX. 
regularly 
renders 
by 
νῆσος, 
I 
have 
not 
departed 
from 
the 
old 
translation 
‘isle,’ 
‘isles.’ 
So 
Vulg. 
’nsula, 
’nsulae. 
That 
‘coastlands’ 
should 
be 
included 
is 
only 
in 
accordance 
with 
ancient 
habits 
of 
speech 
and 
thought, 
not 
yet 
entirely 
extinct.

Vulg.

A.

but 
most

as 
well 
as 
in

οὐδὲ

So 
practically 
all 
interpreters, 
applying 
the 
negative 
to 
this 
clause 
also, 
though 
not 
expressed 
in 
Heb. 
It 
is 
tempting, 
however, 
to 
render 
the 
Heb., 
as 
Cocceius 
(quoted 
by 
Alexander) 
did 
and 
make 
this 
clause 
affirmative: 
‘I 
nourished 
not 
sons, 1 
brought 
up ’; 
implying 
their 
woeful 
fate 
as 
expressed 
in 
ver. 
ὅταν 
δὲ. . . 
Αἰγύπτῳ] 
So 
Vulg., 
and 
prob. 
rightly ; 
R.
V. 
similarly. 
There 
is 
probably 
no 
reference 
to 
the 
‘report 
concerning ’ 
in 
the 
days 
of 
the 
Exodus. 
Egypt 
and 
Tyre 
here 
dread 
a 
common 
foe.
It 
is 
said 
that 
Tyre, 
when 
attacked 
by 
Alexander, 
sent 
refugees 
to 
Carthage : 
so 
Diod. 
Sic. 
XVII. 
Ι ; 
which 
may 
perhaps 
have 
induced 
the 
LXX. 
rendering 
of 
Τarshish 
(see 
on 
ver. 1). 
Strangely 
enough, 
Herodotus, 
I. 163—165, 
makes 
Arganthonius, 
king 
of 
Tartessus, 
the 
Phocaeans 
to 
settle 
in 
his 
land, 
when 
threatened 
by 
the 
Persians 
and 
eventually 
they 
did 
abandon 
their 
city, 
but, 
he 
being 
dead, 
went 
elsewhere.

The

between 
present

is 
not 
very 
great 
in 
point 
of 
letters, 
if

This

give

the

of

unusual.

The

The 
coincidence 
with 
A.
V. 
of 
the 
previous 
verse 
is 
nothing 
more : 
the 
order 
of 
words 
shows 
this, 
and 
there 
is 
no 
reason 
why 
Lxx. 
should 
have 
taken 
me 
(otherwise 
accounted 
for 
in 
the 
previous 
note) 
as 
‘strength.
The 
negative 
in 
the

a 
characteristic 
guess 
from 
the 
supposed 
context.

Though 
‘Canaan’

it 
seems 
not 
to

certainly 
used

With 
this 
attestation, 
it 
seems 
to 
be 
the 
true 
Lxx. 
text, 
that 
is 
to 
say 
an 
error 
in 
reading 
by 
the 
translator, 
or 
at 
any 
rate 
a 
very 
early

Β* 
and 
the 
Luc. 
Mss. 
generally 
agree 
with 
the 
later 
versions 
in 
reading 
Σιδῶνος. 
As 
the 
difference 
in 
Greek 
includes 
the 
presence 
or 
not 
of 
the 
genitive 
termination, 
it 
is 
reasonable 
to 
suppose 
that 
the 
mistake 
was 
made 
in 
reading 
from 
the 
Heb., 
the 
phrase 
‘daughter 
of ’ 
being 
familiar. 
Lxx. 
omit 
‘virgin.’ 
Yet, 
as 
Kay 
points 
out, 
the 
original 
Heb. 
phrase 
might 
have 
conveyed 
an 
alarming 
suggestion.
ἐὰν 
ἀπέλθῃς

As 
actually 
happened, 
see 
above 
on

The 
LXX. 
have 
shortened, 
and 
attempted 
to 
simplify 
this 
verse, 
which 
is 
very 
obscure 
in 
Heb. 
The

must 
be 
simply 
a 
repetition 
from 
ver. 12 
in 
A 
the 
words 
form 
a 
complete 
line. 
The 
sense 
of 
Heb. 
seems 
to 
be, 
‘the 
Chaldaeans, 
with 
all 
their 
power, 
have 
fallen 
before 
Assyria. 
(What 
better

The 
refrain 
comes 
in 
from

prob. 
correct, 
see 
on 
over. 
The 
seventy 
years

correspond 
with 
time 
of

not 
specified 
in 
Isaiah, 
but 
see 
Jerem. 
xxv. 9, 11. 
If 
the 
duration 
of 
the 
Babylonian 
empire, 
roughly 606—536 
B. 
C., 
be 
considered, 
it 
is 
mainly 
‘the

one 
king 
’—N 
ebuchadnezzar. 
He 
ﬁlls 
its 
stage : 
after 
him

nothing

a 
downhill 
course.

that

type 
of

any 
rate 
in

in 
fact,

altered 
the

regard 
to 
this

It 
is 
true 
that ℵ

the

O.
T. 
in 
Greek: 
but 
MSS. 
are 
hardly 
decisive 
as 
to 
ει

ι : 
ῥεμβεύω, 
if 
equivalent 
to 
ῥέμβομαι, 
is 
more 
probably 
intransitive; 
and 
Tyconius, 
p. 46, 
has 
accipe 
citharam, 
vagulare, 
’w’
tas, 
c. 
πόλις 
also 
agrees 
with 
Heb. 
text 
in 
its 
actual 
wording, 
while 
πόλεις 
would 
differ 
in 
number; 
though 
this 
is 
probably 
of 
little 
weight.
εἰς 
τὸ 
ἀρχαῖον] 
Probably 
‘to 
her 
ancient ’ 
the 
neuter 
adj. 
being 
a 
natural 
mode 
of 
expression: 
ἀπὸ

Herod. 
IV. 117. 
is 
rather 
ﬂ’

Heb. 
has 
‘to 
her ’ 
the 
special 
meaning 
which 
carries 
on 
the 
ﬁgure 
being 
clear 
from 
Deut. 
xxiii. 18, 
Hos. 
ii. 14. 
viii. 9, 
ἃς. 
Lxx. 
is 
probably 
euphemistic. 
(The 
mercantile 
use 
of 
ἀρχαῖον=᾿
principal,’ 
as 
in 
Aristoph. 
Cloud: 1156, 
does 
not 
seem 
to 
have 
point 
here.)
It 
is 
however 
possible 
that 
Lxx. 
connected 
the 
word 
with 
INN, 
which 
Theodotion 
renders 
by 
ἀρχαῖον 
in 
Jerem.

to

the

rightly. 
The 
‘song ’ 
prepares 
the 
way 
for 
the

in 
the 
original.
B, 
with 
Theodotion, 
adds 
at 
the 
end 
of

The 
verse 
is 
a 
puzzling 
one 
in 
the 
original, 
and 
has 
hardly 
been 
fully 
explained. 
In 
some 
way 
the 
restored 
Tyre 
is 
to 
be 
dedicated 
to 
the 
Lord; 
her 
commerce 
is 
to 
help 
the 
way 
of 
religion, 
or 
profit 
those 
who 
help 
it; 
her 
fits 
are 
not 
to 
be 
idly 
stored 
up 
and 
meet 
the 
fate 
of 
destruction 
without 
having 
served 
some 
useful 
purpose.
Lxx. 
treat 
with 
some 
freedom, 
omitting 
‘nor 
stored ’ 
and 
the 
substantive 
verb 
‘shall ’) 
in 
the 
next 
clause, 
thus 
altering 
the

difficult,

It 
is 
agreed 
by 
commentators 
that 
these 
chapters 
form 
a 
connected 
section 
of 
the 
book. 
They 
deal 
with 
a 
coming 
catastrophe 
for 
the 
‘land’ 
or 
the 
‘earth,’ 
judgment 
upon 
it, 
but 
joy 
and 
salvation 
for 
the 
righteous.
Many 
modern 
authorities 
hold 
that 
the 
prophecy 
is 
not 
’s, 
assigning 
it 
to 
an 
unknown 
prophet: 
but 
opinions 
vary 
widely 
as 
to 
the 
date, 
on 
this 
supposition. 
Ewald 
placed 
it 
in ’ 
reign, 529--522 
B.
C.; 
Driver, 
writing 
in 1893 
or 1894, 
“in 
the 
early 
years 
after

return 
of 
Israel. . .

536—c. 440”; 
and 
so 1890, 
after 
giving 
up 
’s 
authorship. 
Cheyne, 
in 1870, 
and 
apparently 
as 
late 
at 
any 
rate 
as 1886, 
before 
the 
fall 
of 
Babylon ; 
but 
in 1895 
brought 
it 
down 
to 
about—332 
B.
C.; 
which 
Prof. 
Skinner 
and 
others 
seem 
inclined 
to 
favour. 
The 
late 
Prof. 
Davidson, 
in 
the 
Temple 
Bible, 
“The 
date 
is 
post ” 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
Prof. 
W. 
E. 
Barnes, 
while 
not 
disturbing 
the 
modern ’ 
position 
as 
to 
most 
most 
of 
the 
mainly 
disputed 
chapters, 
holds 
that 
xxiv.—
xxvii. 
are 
Isaiah, 
the 
occasion 
being 
“the 
great 
convulsion 
which 
attended 
the 
invasion 
of 
Sennacherib.”
The 
view 
of 
Duhm, 
who 
refers 
these 
chapters, 
or 
most 
of 
them, 
to 
about 130—105 
B.

defies 
all 
generallyheld 
views

to 
close 
of

Clearly 
‘world’ 
or 
‘earth.’ 
So 
Heb., 
according 
to 
Cheyne, 
and 
cf. 
ver. 4 : 
while 
Ges., 
Hitzig, 
Lowth, 
and 
Prof. 
W. 
E. 
Barnes, 
make 
it 
the 
‘land,’ 
the 
Heb. 
word 
in 
itself 
bearing 
either 
sense. 
Kay 
remarks 
on 
the 
frequency 
with 
which 
the

says, 
“The

While 
the

reader 
is 
bound 
to 
consider 
the 
apparent

little.

Scholz).

Is 
there 
an 
earlier 
use 
of

‘lay’) 
in 
antithesis 
to 
‘priest’ 
than 
the 
LXX.? 
(Cf. 
Hos.

ᾇ 
όΦιλα] 
The 
sentence 
is 
turned 
round 
in

but 
a 
paraphrase 
was 
almost 
a 
necessity.

a 
common 
idiom.

‘Mouth’ 
is 
not 
in 
Heb., 
but 
Lxx. 
use 
the 
familiar 
phrase: 
so 
also 
in 
xxv. 8, 
while 
omitting 
it 
in

Cf.

Nearly 
right, 
according 
to

construe 
‘bear

(Del., 
Kay) 
or 
‘are

Repeated 
instead 
of 
a 
parallel 
verb.
αὐθαδία 
καὶ 
πλάτος 
ἀσεβεῖν] 
Heb. 
‘the 
uproar 
of 
the ’ 
αὐθαδία 
is 
perhaps 
‘wanton 
pride' 
for 
‘noise’ ; 
ἀσεβῶν 
may 
be, 
as 
in 
xxv. 5, 
read 
here 
for 
see 
on 
v. 14. 
καὶ 
πλοῦτος 
is 
not 
represented 
in 
the 
Heb., 
but 
appears 
to 
render 
‘multitude, 
with 
an 
implication 
of 
power, 
in 
xvi. 
I4, 
and, 
forming 
this 
very 
Greek 
phrase, 
in 
xxix. 5; 
whence 
it

else 
may 
be 
a 
duplicate 
attempt 
at

in 
the 
sense 
of 
‘strength’ 
or

in 
that

‘noise,’ 
resembling

gives 
the 
second

’rw’

’tu: 
laetantium 
in 
Vulg., 
as 
an 
addition 
(Zusatz) 
to 
Heb., 
implying 
at 
least 
that 
it 
is 
not 
represented 
in 
Lxx. 
This 
I 
am 
unable 
to 
understand.)
ἠσχύνθησαν] 
(so 
Scholz) 
or 
read 
for 
‘with 
a

The 
syntax 
differs: 
Lxx. 
applies 
‘every’ 
to 
‘city’ 
instead 
of 
‘house,’ 
and 
omits 
‘of 
wasteness' 
(tohu)
πανταχῇ] 
More 
general 
than 
Heb. 
‘in 
the

i.
e. 
the 
streets, 
or 
the 
ﬁelds 
outside 
the 
city.
The 
two 
latter 
clauses 
of 
the 
verse 
are 
merged 
by 
Lxx. 
in 
one : 
or  
 if 
B, 
with 22 23 24 36 48 51 62 87 90 93 97 109 144 147 228 305, 
is 
right 
in 
omitting 
τῆς 
γῆς, 
the 
later 
clause 
is 
omitted 
entirely. 
This 
is 
probable, 
as 
the 
array 
of 
cursives 
against 
RAQ 
is 
unusually 
strong, 
though 
not 
including 26 106 
or 301. 
In 
this 
case 
πέπαυται 
may 
represent 
a 
misreading 
of 
may 
as 
may 
(so 
Govett),
The 
syntax 
varies 
in 
the 
former 
clause: 
in 
the 
latter 
only 
a 
general 
resemblanceis 
preserved: 
ἀπολοῦνται, 
though 
brought 
to 
the 
end 
of 
the 
verse, 
may 
represent 
MM, 
the 
participle 
may 
be 
for 
gate, 
and 
οἶκοι 
suggests 
for 
‘is 
smitten.
πάντα] 
Prob. 53 
read 
for 
or 
‘for,’ 
or 
else 
for 
ma, 
‘thus.’

Cf. 
xvii. 6. 
word, 
in 
various 
senses, 
seems 
to 
be 
a 
favourite 
with 
Isaiah.
The 
apodosis 
in 
the 
Greek 
is 
perhaps 
due 
to 
the 
use 
of 3, 
as 
in 
ver. 2, 
for 
both 
members 
of 
a 
comparison, 
and 
the 
parallel 
words 
‘beating,’ 
‘gleaning’ 
are 
represented 
by 
the 
same 
Greek 
verb, 
αὐτοὺς 
being 
supplied 
in 
accordance 
with 
this 
rendering.
καὶ

To

βοήσονται] 
Β

Luc. 
MSS. 
have 
βοῇ 
φωνήσουσιν. 
It 
is 
difficult 
to 
say 
which 
reading 
is 
intrinsically 
preferable. 
These 
words 
are 
elsewhere 
confused 
in 
MSS., 
as 
xxxiii. 7, 
Judith 
xvi. 
II 
(where 
see 
note 
in 
Variorum 
Apocrypha).
Vol

Probably 
an 
explanation, 
intended 
to 
be 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
figure 
of 
the 
preceding 
verse. 
Cf. 
xiii. 12, 14. 
and 
again 
xvii. 6, 9, 
for 
the 
idea, 
which 
is 
specially 
familiar 
in 
Isaiah.
πραχθήσεται] 
Heb. 
‘they

either 
misread

The 
verse 
has 
been 
recast, 
and 
‘in 
the 
lights,’ 
omitted, 
almost 
certainly 
owing 
to 
confusion 
with 
ἐν 
τοῖς 
νήσοις, 
following. 
Some,.
as 
Lowth, 
have 
wished 
to 
read 
DMD 
in 
both 
places : 
but 
he 
was 
misled 
by 
the 
two 
MSS., 22 
and 93, 
which 
with 
their 
Lucianic 
text, 
and 
Hexaplaric 
additions, 
naturally 
influenced 
him 
by 
their 
points 
of 
special 
resemblance, 
in 
many 
places, 
to 
the 
Heb., 
as 
compared 
with 
other 
Greek 
MSS. 
which 
he 
knew.
πτερύγων] 
So 
Heb., 
literally. 
See 
xi. 
τέρατα] 
Heb. 
‘songs’: 
Lxx. 
may 
be 
a 
paraphrase, 
due 
to 
misunderstanding : 
or 
perhaps, 
for 
they 
read 
news, 
rendered

in 
Exod.

c. 
Ἐλπὶς] 
Heb. 
‘glory’ 
or 
‘honour.' 
LXX. 
may 
have 
fallen 
back 
on 
ἐλπὶς 
as 
a 
favourite 
word 
in 
a 
difficulty : 
or 
taken ‘33, 
by 
misreading, 
from

root

sometimes 
rendered 
by 
ἐλπὶς,

with

Zeph. 
ii. 15 ; 
but.
the

the

‘Wasting

perhaps 
considering 
it 
implied 
in 
the 
interjection.

Cf. 
Gen. 
vii. 11, 
Psalm

lxxviii. 
LXX. 
has 
only 
two 
of 
these 
emphasized 
phrases 
to 
three 
of 
the 
Heb., 
which 
gives 
the 
ideas 
of 
(a) 
cracking 
and 
showing 
rents, 
ὁ) 
bursting 
open, (6) 
swaying 
and 
falling: 
completed 
in 
ver. 20. 
(More 
applicable, 
surely, 
to 
the 
‘earth’ 
than 
the 
‘land.’)
ὀπωροφυλάκιον] 
Cf. 
i. 8, 
same 
word, 
Heb. 
and 
Gk. 
Some 
construe 
it 
‘hammock’ 
rather 
than 
‘hut.’ 
Probably 
the 
structure 
consisted 
of 
a 
rude 
awning 
over 
comerpoles; 
such 
a 
thing 
as 
a 
gale 
would 
whirl 
contemptuously 
away.

Heb. 
‘is

cf. 
Ps.

more 
resembles

The

follows

whereas 
in

it 
differs, 
the 
Heb. 
clauses 
being 
arranged 
as 
follows: 
the 
verbs 
of 
a

b 
come 
ﬁrst, 
then 
the

then 
clause 
d,

lastly

cursives 
support

Lxx. 
omits 
‘in

and 
the 
corresponding 
‘on

earth' 
(or, 
‘ground’).
NAQ 
again 
vary 
from 
the 
Heb. 
order, 
with 
modification 
of 
syntax; 
B 
retains 
it, 
with 
insertion 
of 
συναγωγὴν 
αὐτῆς; 
συναγωγὴν 
corresponds 
to 
the 
Heb. 
noun 
after 
its 
kindred 
verb: 
but 
αὐτῆς 
is 
awkward, 
γῆς 
being 
the 
only 
noun 
to 
which 
it 
can 
refer. 
RAQ 
are 
supported 
by 41 49 87 91 97 106 195 228 301 306 309 (26 
partly).
τακήσεται] 
Heb. 
‘shall 
blush': 
parallel 
to 
‘be 
ashamed' 
in 
i. 29, 
where 
LXX. 
does 
not 
distinguish. 
Here 
Scholz, 
following 
Schleusner, 
suggests 
that 
LXX. 
read 
man 
(from 
instead 
of 
man. 
Or 
more 
probably 
their 
rendering 
depends 
on 
their 
mistake 
in 
the 
following 
words, 
as 
πεσεῖται 
seems 
to 
do: 
else 
we 
might 
conjecture 
that 
they 
read 
than

πλίνθος] 
Heb. 
‘the 
moon,' 
also, 
with 
one 
change 
of 
pointing, 
has 
this 
meaning 
of 
‘brick’: 
both 
senses 
from 
the 
root 
meaning 
‘white.’ 
From 
this 
the 
whole 
divergence 
of 
the 
verse 
seems 
to 
arise.
τεῖχος] 
Reading 
non 
‘sun’ 
as 
‘wall.’ 
These 
words 
for 
‘sun’ 
and 
‘moon’ 
are 
poetic 
in 
tone; 
they 
are 
rightly 
rendered 
by 
LXX. 
in 
xxx. 
The 
correct 
rendering 
of 
Heb., 
from 
Symmachus, 
appears 
as 
a 
duplicate

Rightly

place).
ἀληθινήν· 
γένοιτο] 
Heb. 
has 
two 
kindred 
words, 
‘truth,’ 
true. 
LXX. 
translates 
the 
ﬁrst 
rightly, 
except 
that 
it 
is 
rather 
to 
be 
taken 
as 
subst. 
than 
adj., 
while 
the 
second 
they 
took 
to 
be 
the 
familiar 
asse. ‘ 
‘verily,’ 
‘Amen’; 
so 
Vulg., 
but 
Heb. 
text 
points 
it 
differently 
here.
Κύριε] 
Not 
in 
Heb., 
but 
B 
is 
alone 
or 
nearly 
so 
in 
omitting 
it. 
It 
is 
frequently 
inserted 
in 
this 
and 
the

chapter.

Paraphrase 
of 
Heb. 
‘ruin.’ 
B

taken 
it 
as 
an 
explanation

in 
a 
bad 
sense: 
a 
“general 
term 
for 
the 
enemies 
of

Delitzsch 
says. 
It 
is 
not 
the

but 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
εἷς 
has 
dropped 
out 
after

LXX. 
have 
apparently 
omitted 
the 
preposition 
before 
‘city,’ 
τὸ 
θεμέλια 
corresponding 
to 
‘castle’ 
in 
the 
order. 
In 
the

the 
same 
force 
as 
in

ὁ 
πτωχὸς] 
Reading 
‘poor’ 
for 
‘strong’ 
(Scholz). 
ἀδικουμένην] 
Here 
and 
in 
ver. 4 
the 
Lxx. 
have 
chosen 
to 
use 
a 
passive 
participle, 
probably 
misled 
by 
their 
view 
of 
the 
context. 
This 
Heb. 
verb 
is 
not 
passively 
used, 
but 
Lxx., 
with 
no 
vowelpointing 
to 
guide 
them, 
may 
not 
have 
known 
this. 
They 
generally 
render 
it 
with 
active 
sense, 
or 
by 
such 
a 
word 
as 
ὑπερήφανος ; 
see 
xiii. 
H, 
xxix. 
εὐλογήσουσίν 
σε] 
The 
verb 
is 
repeated, 
instead 
of 
the 
Heb. 
parallel.
βοηθὸς] 
The 
Lxx. 
seem 
to 
have 
been 
confused 
here. 
The 
word 
for 
‘stronghold.' 
occurring 
twice, 
seems 
to 
have 
been 
misread, 
ﬁrst 
as 
‘city,’ 
and 
then 
as 
‘help.’ 
ταπεινῇ 
is 
right; 
πασῇ 
may 
be

It 
may 
be 
supposed 
that 
up 
to 
this 
point 
the 
Greek 
corresponds 
sufficiently 
well 
with 
Heb. 
Here 
divergence 
begins 
again 
LXX. 
Lxx. 
probably 
reading 
‘from 
strangers,' 
see 
ver. 2, 
instead 
of 
‘from 
the 
storm.’
ῥύσῃ 
αὐτοὺς] 
Probably 
‘shadow,' 
guessed 
or 
read 
as 
some 
part 
of 
‘deliver': 
perhaps 
Hiphil 
impf. 
with 
D 
from 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
next 
word 
possibly 
read 
as 3 
pl. 
pronoun 
objecttermination.
σκέπη] 
Either 
repeated 
from 
previous

or 
a

in 
the 
latter 
case 
it 
stands 
for 
two 
different 
words 
in 
the 
verse.
διψώντων] 
This, 
and 
διψῶντες 
in 
ver. 5, 
appear 
to 
stand 
for 
Heb. 
‘heat,' 
‘drought.
καὶ 
πνεῦμα] 
Heb. 
has 
not 
‘amd,’ 
but 
‘for.’ 
The 
word 
translated 
‘blast’ 
is 
the 
ordinary 
word 
for 
‘spirit’ 
or 
‘breath’ : 
and 
with 
ἀδικουμένων, 
as 
in 
ver. 3, 
Lxx. 
have 
given 
a 
different 
turn 
to 
the 
meaning.

Repeated

ὥς

Again 
is 
difficult 
to 
reconcile 
with 
Heb.; 
 from 
the 
end 
of 
previous 
verse 
may 
have 
been 
read 
as 
and 
ὀλιγόψυχοι 
suggests 
which 
may 
have 
been 
the 
attempt 
to 
read 
It 
would, 
however, 
be 
generally 
followed 
by 
in 
this 
sense : 
see 
Exod. 
vi. 9. 
(Or 
if 
ἄνθρωποι 
were 
an 
addition 
of 
LXX., 
 might 
have 
been 
read 
as 
and 
as 
‘deﬁcient’ 
or 
 ‘failing."
ἐν 
Σιὼν] 
Heb. 
here 
differs 
from 
‘Zion’ 
in 
pointing, 
and 
means 
‘a 
parched ’: 
Lxx. 
renders 
it 
Σιὼν 
also 
in 
xxxii. 2, 
its 
only 
other 
occurrence. 
Words 
from 
the 
same 
root 
occur, 
xiii. 21, 
xxxiv. 14 
‘desert 
creatures,' 
and 
Job 
xxiv. 19 
‘drought.
οἷς 
ἡμᾶς 
παρέδωκας] 
Assuming 
that 
ἀπὸ 
ἀνθ. 
ἀσεβῶν 
represents 
either 
or 
we 
have 
about 
six 
Heb. 
words 
to 
account 
for, 
and 
this 
clause 
bears 
no 
perceptible 
resemblance 
to 
any 
of 
them. 
LXX., 
after 
being 
in 
difficulties 
for 
some 
time, 
fall 
back 
on 
their 
favourite 
παραδίδωμι; 
cf. 
xxiii. 7. 
Their 
MSS. 
may 
have 
been 
illegible 
at 
this 
point ; 
but 
it 
will 
be 
noticed 
that 
passages 
with 
the 
same 
words 
recurring 
constantly 
are 
apt 
to 
reduce 
them 
to 
helplessness.
Lxx. 
again 
shortens 
considerably; 
and 
though 
the 
translator 
appears 
confused 
by 
repetitions 
in 
the 
Heb., 
the 
possibility 
of 
intentional 
shortening 
must 
not 
be 
entirely 
overlooked.
ἐπὶ 
το

Either 
the 
force 
of 
acc. 
with 
prep. 
is 
lost, 
=‘they 
shall 
go 
to 
this 
mountain 
to 
drink. . .' 
See 
on 
ii. 
χρίσονται 
μύρον] 
The 
two 
preceding 
phrases 
read 
like 
a 
shortening 
of 
the 
rest 
of 
ver. 6: 
yet 
it 
looks 
as 
if 
the 
translator 
had 
somehow 
extracted 
what 
he 
took 
for 
from 
 ‘a 
feast 
of ’ 
εὐφροσύνην, 
above, 
may 
be 
nniw 
for 
one 
of 
the, 
similar 
words 
ἡ 
μὰρ 
βουλή] 
Heb. 
‘the 
covering 
that ’ 
apparently: 
the 
preceding 
clause, 
παράδος 
πάντα 
ταῦτα, 
being 
another 
case 
of 
παραδίδωμι 
used 
to 
cover 
the 
’s 
perplexity. 
With 
the 
Greek 
compare 
xxviii. 8, 
equally 
puzzling. 
The 
Heb. 
word 
is 
obscure, 
and 
belongs 
to 
a 
difficult 
group 
(see 
on 
xxii. 8) ; 
the 
noun 
or 
verb 
is 
found 
in 
xxix. 
IO, 
xxx. 
I, 22 : 
in 
xxx. 
ι, 
Lxx. 
has 
συνθήκας, 
and 
some 
authorities 
(Lowth, 
Gesenius) 
have 
assigned 
it 
the 
sense 
of 
libation 
attending 
a 
treaty 
or 
covenant. 
Here, 
at 
any 
rate, 
the 
Lxx. 
are 
obviously 
labouring 
amid 
difficulties, 
and 
may 
be 
merely 
guessing.
κατέπιεν 
ὅ 
Θάνατος 
ἰσχύσας] 
Except 
for 
ver. 7 
and 8 
in 
Heb. 
begin 
with 
the 
same 
word, 
Heb. 
points 
it 
as 
active, 
the 
object 
being 
‘Death.' 
So 
Aq., 
Symm., 
Vulgate.
In 1 
Cor. 
xv. 54, 
St 
Paul 
quotes 
the 
verse, 
in 
the 
words 
of 
Theo-
’s 
version, 
κατεπόθη 
ὁ 
θάνατος 
εἷς 
νῖκος, 
and 
couples 
it 
with 
a 
quotation 
of 
Hosea 
xiii. 14, 
which 
is 
on 
the 
whole 
nearer 
to 
Lxx. 
than 
to 
Heb., 
though 
νῖκος 
is 
apparently 
substituted 
for 
δίκη 
(Heb. 
LXX.'
s 
rendering 
of 
by 
ἰσχύσας 
is 
not 
altogether 
without 
warrant: 
mt:

used 
as 
a 
title 
of 
God 
in 1 
Sam. 
xv. 29, 
where 
they 
perhaps 
mistook 
it 
for 
‘the 
Strength 
(of ’ 
A.
V., 
or 
‘Splendour.' 
There 
LXX. 
translate 
differently, 
while 
in 
ι 
Chron. 
xxix.

 νίκη 
is 
used, 
ἰσχὺς 
following 
as 
a 
rendering

The 
rootmeaning 
appears 
to 
be 
‘lustre,' 
‘brightness'; 
and 
hence 
its 
use 
for 
‘victory,’ 
‘glory.’ 
The 
idiomatic 
meaning 
of 
the 
present 
phrase, 
is 
however, 
according 
to 
most 
modems, 
‘for ’: 
cf. 
xxviii. 28, 
xxxiv.

in 
sempilernum, 
Vulg.

Inserted 
by 
Lxx. 
to 
suit 
the 
contrast, 
according 
to 
their 
rendering: 
cf. 
xxx. 
ἀφεῖλεν] 
Perhaps 
the 
second 
verb 
has 
taken 
the 
place 
also 
of 
the 
ﬁrst; 
where 
ἐξαλείψει 
(as 
in 
Rev. 
vii. 17, 
xxi. 4) 
would 
be 
more 
accurate.

as 
the

against

an 
ingenious 
reference 
to 
the 
middle 
name 
in 
the 
verse, 
Josh. 
xv. 3 
I 
(Madmannah) 
and 
xix. 5 
(Bethmarcaboth). 
Perhaps, 
however, 
is 
as 
probably 
what 
Lxx. 
read.
Madmen 
was 
the 
name 
of 
a 
town 
of 
Moab, 
Jer. 
xlviii. 2: 
and 
it 
may 
be 
referred 
to 
here, 
either 
directly, 
or 
with 
a 
play 
on 
words, 
for 
which 
mathben 
‘straw') 
prepares 
the 
way.

Lxx. 
perhaps 
read

there 
is 
some 
further 
confusion 
in 
the 
verse, 
‘in

omitted, 
as 
frequently, 
xix. 3, 
c.: 
καὶ

may 
be 
an 
attempt 
to 
render 
the 
repeated 
verb 
idiomatically, 
but 
is 
hardly 
in 
the 
usual 
manner 
of 
the 
Lxx.
The 
meaning 
of 
the 
original 
is 
not 
free 
from 
difficulty.

The 
primary 
meaning 
of

‘strength,’

the

apply 
the

to 
the

The

is 
varied 
by 
LXX.,

giving 
a 
more 
decided 
turn 
to 
the 
sense, 
though 
substantially 
right.

for 
the

but

continues 
to

(see 
below).
Cf.

έπιθυμεῖ 
ἢ

The 
Heb. 
has 
this 
phrase 
at 
the 
end 
of 
ver. 8 
and 
again, 
with 
change 
of 
order, 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 9. 
Lxx. 
have 
it 
only 
once, 
and 
omit 
‘thee,’ 
which 
with 
ἡμῶν 
and 
the 
order 
of 
words, 
shows 
that 
it 
is 
the 
end 
of 
ver. 8 
which 
is 
represented 
in 
the 
Greek.
ὁρθρίζα] 
Prob. 
the 
best 
word 
obtainable 
to 
render 
the 
Heb., 
which 
means 
‘to 
do 
(anything) ’ 
Lxx. 
omit 
‘within ’ 
same 
phrase 
as 
one 
of 
two 
meaning 
‘in 
the ’ 
so 
frequently 
omitted: 
see 
on 
xix. 3,

διότι 
Φῶς 
τὰ 
προστάγματα] 
Heb. 
‘for 
when 
thy 
judgments. . . ' 
Lxx. 
may 
have 
read 
‘as 
a 
light' 
for 
‘when’: 
the 3 
being 
left 
untranslated, 
or 
ὡς 
dropping 
out 
before 
φῶς. 
It 
is, 
however, 
possible 
that 
it 
is 
a 
guess, 
or 
reminiscence 
from 
such 
passages 
as 
Ps. 
xix. 8 
cxix. 105, 
Prov. 
vi. 
The

is

πέπανται] 
Heb. 
‘Let...

Lxx. 
may 
have 
taken 
the 
verb 
not 
from 
pn, 
but 
from 
nan, 
used 
of 
the 
day 
declining, 
Judg. 
xix. 9 ; 
or 
possibly 
from 
nu, 
Hophal 
in 
Lam. 
v. 5, 
where 
Lxx. 
have 
ἀνεπαύθημεν.
οὗ

but ℵ 
c 
AQ 
and 
most 
cursives 
(not 106, 
acc. 
to 
Holmes 
and 
Parsons) 
as 
well 
as 
Syrohex., 
omit 
the 
words, 
which 
are 
not 
in 
Heb.; 
though 53 
might 
have 
been 
read 
in 
duplicate 
as 
but 
it 
looks 
like 
a 
scribe'
s 
wouldbe  
 improvement, 
taking 
the 
form 
of 
many 
pronouncements 
of 
the 
Law 
(Lev. 
xviii. 29,  
c.)
The 
syntax 
again 
differs 
from 
Heb., 
and 
there 
are 
further 
discrepancies. 
ἀλήθειαν 
apparently 
corresponds 
to 
‘uprightness,’ 
which 
is 
here 
not 
but 
a 
word 
used 
in 
xxx. 10 ; 
lvii. 2 
is 
closely 
akin, 
and 
the 
passages 
should 
be 
compared 
in 
Lxx.: 
note 
ἀρθήτω, 
ἦρται 
(perhaps 
some 
form 
from 
rm 
read 
for 
and 
in 
that 
case 
a 
duplicate 
here).
ὁ 
ἀσεβὴς 
seems 
to 
stand 
in 
the 
place 
of 
the 
verb 
‘will 
deal 
unjustly.’
ᾔδεισαν, 
γνόντες] 
Heb. 
has 
same 
word, 
meaning 
‘see’ 
(i. 1 
xxx. 
IO, 
c.) 
rather 
than 
‘know.’
λήμψεται, 
ἀπαίδευτον] 
These 
words 
are 
added 
by 
Lxx., 
giving 
a 
new 
colour 
to 
the 
sentence. 
’s 
suggestion, 
apparently, 
is 
that 
they 
read 
ppm 
δι’ 
ἀπαιδευσίαν, 
Hosea 
vii. 16) 
after 
‘people.
Cf. 
Aesch. 
Agam. 180, 
καὶ 
παρ’ 
ἄκοντας 
ἦλθε 
σωφρονεῖν. 
Also 
the 
conclusion 
of 
the 
passage 
quoted 
below, 
on 
ver. 
ὁ 
θεὸς] 
Added 
here 
by 
Lxx.; 
cf. 
ver. 13, 
where 
Β* 
omits 
Κύριε 
ὁ 
θεὸς 
ἡμῶν.
πάντα. 
ἀπέδωκας 
ἡμῖν] 
Heb. 
‘hast 
wrought 
all 
our 
works 
for ’ 
LXX.'
s 
rendering 
erhaps 
comes 
from 
the 
use 
of 
the 
noun 
corresponding 
to 
the 
verb 175 
here 
used, 
to 
mean 
‘wages,’ 
‘reward’ 
of 
work. 
See 
xl. 
Io, 
xlix. 4, 
lxii. 11 ; 
cf. 
Levit. 
xix. 
Lxx. 
has 
again 
different 
syntax, 
altering 
the 
sense 
considerably: 2 
pers. 
sing. 
imperat. 
for 
3rd 
pers. 
plur. 
perf., 
of 
verb, 
and 
‘lords’ 
rendered 
as 
a 
vocative. 
κτῆσαι] 
The 
Heb. 
verb 
is 
connected 
with 
Baal 
‘lord’). 
Cf. 
the 
very 
different 
rendering 
in 
lxii. 5. 
The 
converse 
of 
this 
verse 
may 
be 
seen 
in 
iii. 18 ; 
but 
the 
verb, 
both 
in 
Heb. 
and 
Gr., 
is 
different.
ἄλλσ 
οὐκ 
οἴδαμεν] 
Heb. 
has 
‘only 
by ’: 
ἄλλον 
may 
represent 
only, 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
‘separate’: 
οὐκ 
may 
be ‘13 
read 
as 52. 
We 
are 
then 
left 
with 
οἴδαμεν, 
τὸ 
ὄνομά 
σου 
ὀνομάζομεν, 
to 
represent 
 Ἴων). 
The 
noun 
is 
obvious, 
but 
which 
of 
the 
two 
verbs 
does 
 stand 
for? 
As 
the 
verb 
and 
noun 
in 
Heb. 
are 
not 
kindred, 
and 
as 
the 
order 
of 
words 
is 
generally 
followed 
by 
LXX., 
there 
is 
a 
presumption 
that 
οἴδαμεν 
stands 
for 
it, 
and 
ὀνομάζομεν 
is 
a 
supplement 
in 
the 
Creek. 
The 
meaning 
of 
the 
Heb. 
verb 
is 
not 
οἶδα 
but 
μιμνήσκω, 
‘remember. 
‘call 
to ’: 
but 
LXX. 
may 
have 
read 
it 
as 
(Piel), 
‘recognise,’ 
‘acknowledge.
With 
ver. 13, 14, 
there 
should 
be 
compared 
Aesch. 
Again. 168 
foll., 
which 
represents 
an 
idea 
as 
near 
to 
’s 
as 
a 
devout 
heathen 
warrior 
could 
compass:
ζωὴν 
οὐ 
μὴ 
ἴδωσιν] 
Heb. 
simply 
‘shall 
not 
live.’ 
The 
Greek 
seems 
to 
combine 
the 
two 
ideas 
found 
in 
Ps. 
xxxiv. 8 
and 
in 
xxxvi. 
ἰατροὶ] 
Heb. 
Rephaim: 
see 
on 
xiv. 9. 
Here 
rendered 
by 
most 
‘shades,’ 
but 
referred 
by 
some 
(esp. 
Prof. 
W. 
E. 
Barnes) 
to 
the 
old 
inhabitants 
of 
the 
land, 
“once 
greatly 
feared, 
but 
extinct 
in 
Isaiah’
s 
day.” 
Ver. 
ι8, 19 
may 
be 
thought 
to 
favour 
this 
idea; 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
xiv. 9 
and 
Ps. 
lxxxviii. 
1O 
are 
against 
it.
LXX., 
with 
their 
mistaken 
rendering 
of 
the 
word, 
have 
proceeded 
to 
take ‘ 
rise’ 
as 
causal : ℵ* 
however 
seems 
to 
have 
read 
ἀναστήσονται.
ἐπήγαγες] 
Generally 
with 
τὴν 
χεῖρα, 
to 
render 
Heb. 
visit,’ 
‘set 
over’: 
so 
xxiv. 21, 
&amp;
c.; 
but 
cf. 
x. 
πᾶν 
ἄρσιν] 
Heb. 
‘all 
their 
memory’: 
or, 
‘every 
memorial.’ 
Two 
meanings 
are 
assigned 
to 
the 
root 
(or 
roots) 
 (a) 
to 
remember, 
call 
to 
mind: 
(b) 
to 
be 
a 
male.
πρόσθη...
κακὰ] 
Heb. ‘ 
thou 
hast 
added 
to 
the 
nation ’ 
(twice). 
The 
insertion 
of 
κακὰ 
by 
the 
LXX. 
may 
be 
due 
to 
a 
misreading 
of 
 which 
does 
not 
appear 
in 
the 
Greek 
otherwise: 
or 
it 
may 
be 
due 
to 
interpretation, 
implying 
a 
meaning 
as 
in 
chap. 
xv. 9, 
‘more,’ 
lit. 
‘additions’ ; 
possibly 
also 
in 
Ps. 
cxx. 
The 
rest 
of 
the 
verse 
is 
shortened 
by 
the 
omission 
of 
‘thou’ 
hast 
enlarged 
all 
the 
borders’ 
supplied, 
doubtless 
from 
a 
later 
version, 
in 
V 109 305 (* 
Q 
mg). 
τοῖς 
ἐνδόξοις 
seems 
to 
correspond 
to 
the 
verb ‘ 
hast 
gotten 
thee 
glory.’
Scholz, 
however, 
thinks 
ἐνδόξοις 
represents 
 ‘princes’ 
for 
borders’: 
and 
the 
resemblance 
is 
certainly 
close. 
There 
seem 
to 
be 
traces 
of 
a 
duplicate 
rendering 
in 
the 
text.
ἐμνήσην] 
Heb. 
3rd 
per. 
plur.: 
the 
sense 
here 
is 
not 
far 
from 
the 
Heb. 
verb, 
which 
is 
more 
properly 
‘inquired 
for’: 
 usual 
meaning 
‘visit.’
ἐν 
θλίψει 
μικρᾷ] 
The 
previous 
θλίψει 
was 
correct 
for 
Heb. 
 Here 
Heb. 
has 
‘they 
poured 
out’ 
 which 
might 
be 
similarly 
translated, 
taking 
it 
from 
be 
in 
distress,’ 
though 
it 
is 
not 
impos-
 sible 
that 
LXX. 
read 
again. 
μικρᾷ 
stands 
in 
the 
corresponding 
place 
to 
‘a ’: 
perhaps 
reading 29511, 
translated 
ἀδύνατος· 
in 
Joel 
iii. 10, 
and 
cf. 
the 
transposition 
in 
xiv. 12: 
or 
possibly 
 ‘failure.
τῷ 
ἀγαπητῷ 
σου] 
Nothing 
appears 
in 
the 
Heb. 
text 
to 
correspond 
to 
these 
words.
διὸ, 
τὸν 
Φόβον 
σου] 
Heb. 
(ver. 17) 
‘at 
thy ’: 
lit. 
‘from 
thy ’ 
often 
used 
in 
connection 
with 
fear: 
cf. 
ii. 10, 19, 
and 
Psalm 
lxxvi. 
καὶ 
ἐτέκομεν. 
πνεῦμα 
σωτηρίας 
σου 
ἐποιήσαμεν] 
If 
we 
place 
the 
stop 
after 
πνεῦμα, 
the 
sentence 
resembles 
the 
Heb. 
more 
nearly, 
as 
accented 7 
and 
interpreted. 
Grabe 
supplied 
οὐ 
to 
the 
Greek 
text, 
which 
is 
otherwise 
in 
direct 
contradiction 
to 
the 
Hebrew: 
and 
if 
we 
suppose 
that 
σωτηρίας 
οὐ 
ποίησομεν 
was 
the 
original 
LXX., 
we 
have 
only 
the 
repeated 
ς, 
the 
ε, 
and 
change 
of 
ο 
to 
a, 
which 
would 
follow 
as 
a 
matter 
of 
course, 
to 
explain, 
as 
probable 
corruptions.
πεσοῦνται] 
The 
Heb. 
word 
here, 
and 
its 
causal 
form 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
next 
verse 
(rendered 
intrans., 
πεσεῖται) 
are 
taken 
by 
some 
commentators 
of 
coming 
and 
bringing 
to 
the 
birth. 
It 
is 
not 
so 
used 
elsewhere 
in 
the 
Bible, 
but 
similar 
uses 
of 
corresponding 
words 
are 
found 
(see 
Prof. 
’s 
note 
ad 
lac.) 
in 
various 
languages: 
English 
‘drop' 
perhaps 
the 
Greek 
use 
of 
ἔρση 
(Horn. 
0d. 
IX. 222) 
and 
δρόσος 
in 
Aesch.

John 
v. 28, 29, 
xi. 38, 44, 
Rev. 
xx. 
ἴαμα] 
Heb. 
word 
means 
(a) 
light, 
ὁ) 
joy, 
and 
(c) 
herbs, 
as 
in 2 
Kings 
iv. 39. 
It 
might 
be 
that 
LXX. 
combined 
these 
into 
the 
notion 
of 
‘healing.’ 
Prof. 
Cheyne, 
however 
’tz’
ca 
(critica 
Biblica, 1., 
p. 33), 
suggests 
the 
reading 011318, 
comparing 
lviii. 8, 
Jer. 
xxx. 
(Lxx. 
xxxvii.) 17, 
where 
Lxx. 
have 
ἰάματα, 
ἴαμα, 
for 
we 
may 
add 
Jer. 
viii. 22 
ϊασθς.
The 
effect 
of 
the 
dew 
(Deut. 
xxxii. 2), 
of 
the 
lights 
(James 
i. 17), 
is 
like 
that 
of 
the 
breath 
from 
the 
four 
winds, 
Ezek. 
xxxvii.

See 
above, 
on

Matt. 
vi. 6 
recalls 
both 
this 
passage 
and 2 
Kings 
iv. 33. 
Tertullian 
quotes 
this

The 
expression 
ὅσον 
ὅσον 
is 
rare: 
it 
occurs 
in 
Heb. 
x. 37, 
possibly 
a 
reference 
to 
this 
passage: 
see 
Bp

note 
in 
his 
Comm. 
on 
the

XXVII. 
Though 
hitherto 
in 
this 
section 
there 
has 
been 
little 
specific 
mention 
of 
the 
surrounding 
nations, 
it 
is 
evident 
that 
they 
are 
symbolically 
referred 
to 
here. 
The 
questions 
are, 
how 
many 
creatures 
are 
spoken 
of, 
and, 
according 
to 
the 
number, 
which 
nations 
they 
represent. 
If 
one, 
it 
is 
most 
likely 
Egypt : 
if 
two, 
Assyria 
and 
Egypt: 
if 
three, 
AssyriaBabylon 
(Leviathan 
under 
two 
aspects), 
and 
Egypt. 
From 
the 
LXX. 
it 
would 
perhaps 
be 
thought 
that 
only 
one 
was 
spoken 
of: 
but 
the 
Hebrew 
suggests 
two, 
at 
any 
rate, 
and 
this 
idea 
is 
strengthened 
by 
a 
comparison 
of 
Ezek., 
esp. 
xvii. 
and 
xxxi., 
and 
by 
the 
consideration 
of 
’s 
position 
between 
two 
greater 
powers. 
Then 
Ezek. 
xxiii. 
tends 
to 
show 
that 
Babylon 
may 
be 
regarded 
as 
a 
renewed 
and 
modified 
form 
of 
the 
Assyrian 
power, 
and 
the 
double 
description 
of 
Leviathan 
is 
thus 
accounted 
for. 
Delitzsch 
explains 
the 
‘ﬂeeing’ 
or 
‘ﬂeet’ 
serpent 
as 
emblematic 
of 
Nineveh 
on 
the 
“arrowy ” 
and 
the 
‘coiled’ 
or 
‘crooked’ 
of 
Babylon 
on 
the 
winding 
Euphrates.
The 
dragon, 
for 
Egypt, 
is 
referred 
to 
in 
li. 9, 
cf. 
Ezek. 
xxix. 3 
xxxii. 2; 
and 
Ps. 
lxxiv. 13, 14, 
where, 
however, 
the 
separation 
of 
‘leviathan ’ 
and 
the 
dragon 
is 
not 
so 
clear, 
if 
intended.
ἁγίαν] 
LXX., 
acc. 
to 
Scholz, 
read 
amp 
for 
mopn, 
‘hard,’ 
‘stern.’ 
Cf. 
viii. 
τὸν 
δράκοντα] ℵ 
as 
well 
as 
Q 
mg 
and 
some 
Luc. 1458., 
with 93 109 305, 
have 
the 
Hexaplaric 
addition 
τὸν 
ἐν 
τῇ 
θαλάσσῃ, 
from 
Aq. 
or 
Symm.
ἐπιθύμημα] 
Reading 
as 
do 
some 
Heb. 
MSS., 
‘desire’ 
for 
sun 
‘wine’ 
(foaming): 
καλός 
preceding 
looks 
like 
a 
duplicate 
of 
more 
general 
meaning.
ἐξάρχειν] 
Probably 
‘to 
begin 
a 
song,’ 
as 
this 
word 
is 
frequently 
used 
of 
music, 
almost 
‘to 
prelude’: 
generally 
with 
acc. 
of 
the 
song, 
but 
also 
absolutely, 
as 
Pind. 
Nam. 11. 40, 
ἁδυμελεῖ 
δ’ 
ἐξάρχετε 
φωνᾷ.
πολιορκουμένη] 
Perhaps 
another 
interpretation 
of 
verb 
‘guard,’ 
or 
read 
as 
from 
a 
kindred 
word. 
πόλις, 
which 
takes 
the 
place 
of 
the 
Divine 
Name, 
may 
be 
a 
guess, 
and 
πόλις 
ἰσχυρὰ 
a 
duplicate.
μάτην] 
Perhaps 
 ‘in 
vain’ 
read 
for 
every 
moment.’
ἁλώσεται] 
Corresponds 
in 
place 
to 
‘hurt,’ 
but 
with 
the 
voice 
changed : 
‘night’ 
and 
‘day’ 
are 
separated 
in 
their 
clauses, 
and 
πεσεῖται 
looks 
like 
a 
guess, 
the 
root 
‘I 
will 
keep’ 
having 
the 
confusing 
letters 
 again.
τεῖχος] 
Belongs 
in 
the 
Heb. 
to 
the 
next 
verse, 
being 
obviously 
 for 
‘heat’ 
(of 
anger, 
&amp;
c.): 
cf. 
xxiv. 23, 
whence 
perhaps 
πεσεῖται. 
Some 
authorities 
have 
approved 
the 
reading 
here 
of 
LXX., 
making 
it 
the 
vineyard 
that 
speaks, 
‘I 
have 
(there 
is 
to 
me) 
no 
wall,’ 
τεῖχος 
οὐκ 
ἔστιν.
ἥ 
οὐκ 
ἐπελάβετο 
αὐτῆς] 
Heb. 
has 
only 
‘to 
me,’ 
see 
previous 
note, 
so 
that 
this 
clause 
is 
practically 
an 
addition 
of 
LΧΧ. 
The 
whole 
passage 
is 
exceedingly 
obscure, 
and 
the 
translator, 
not 
unnaturally, 
in 
difﬁculties.,
φυλάσσειν] 
 ‘to 
watch’ 
for 
 ‘briers’: 
καλάμην 
is 
sufﬁciently 
near 
to 
‘thorns ’: 
ἐν 
ἀγρῷ 
is 
an 
addition 
on 
the 
part 
of 
LΧΧ., 
or 
perhaps 
a 
duplicate, 
based 
on 
a 
misreading 
of 
the 
following 
word 
‘in 
battle,’ 
which 
διὰ 
τὴν 
πολεμίαν 
seems 
to 
represent.
ἠθέτηκα] 
Reading 
‘I 
would 
march 
against 
it’ 
from 
 ‘rebel,’ 
constructed 
with 
 cf. 
i. 2: 
instead 
of 
κατακέκαυμαι] 
This 
seems 
to 
correspond 
with 
‘I 
would 
burn 
it’: 
the 
preceding 
words, 
τοίνυν...
συνέταξεν 
must 
therefore 
be 
an 
intrusion.
Cf. 
Lam. 
ii. 17, 
Dan. 
iv. 35 
(Theod. 32), 
Ps. 
cxv. 3, 
cxxxv. 
βοήσονται...

LΧΧ. 
still 
diﬁ’
ers 
from 
Heb., 
where 
nothing 
corresponding 
to 
these 
words 
occurs. 
Heb. 
‘Or 
else 
let 
him 
take 
hold 
of 
me,’ 
suggests 
that 
the 
words 
from 
ver. 4, 
reading 
for 
ἣ, 
ἢ 
(οὐκ) 
ἐπελάβετο 
αὐτῆς, 
belong 
here. 
(For 
ἣ, 
Luc. 
MSS. 
vary 
between 
ὃς

ποιήσωμεν 
εἰρήνην] 
Repeated 
in 
ℵAQ 
and 
most 
MSS., 
with 
Heb.: 
but 
not 
in 
B, 62. 
Kay 
points 
out 
the 
correspondence 
with 
xxvi. 
τέκνα] 
According 
to 
the 
order, 
this 
corresponds 
to 
shall 
take 
root’: 
prob. 
LΧΧ. 
took 
it 
as 
a 
noun, 
overlooking 
θ, 
and 
interpregid.
μαχόμενος] 
Heb. 
has 
a 
curious 
form, 
which 
is 
by 
some 
thought 
to 
be 
a 
reduplication 
of 
the 
word 
seak, 
a 
measure: 
hence, 
‘by  
 measuremeasure,’ 
i.
e. 
in 
moderation, 
or, 
in 
exact 
measure. 
Others 
render, 
‘by 
affrighting 
her,' 
or 
‘driving 
her 
forth.’
Scholz 
considers 
that 
not. 
read, 
by 
a 
mistake 
of 
sound, 
mm 
for 
memo: 
cf. 
Habak. 
ii. 7; 
he 
further 
gets 
an 
equivalent 
for 
ὀνειδίζων 
from 
the 
ﬁnal 
n 
and 
a 
supposed 
repetition 
of 
w: 
from 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
next 
word. 
This 
however 
seems 
scarcely 
satisfactory: 
perhaps 
Lxx. 
thought 
of 
one 
of 
the 
difficult 
words 
on, 
xi. 
IO, 
lix. 19, 
with 
which 
they 
were 
hardly 
able 
to 
deal.
ἐξαποστελῶ] 
Heb. 
‘by 
(or, 
when) 
sending 
her ’: 
cf. 
xvi. 
οὗ 
σὺ 
ἦσθα. 
ὅ 
pansy] 
The 
syntax 
is 
altered, 
and 
‘thou 
contendest 
bears 
no 
apparent 
relation 
to 
οὐ 
σὺ 
ἦσθα. 
But 
‘he 
driveth 
her 
away 
is 
also, 
by 
some, 
rendered 
‘he 
sigheth': 
and 
run, 
‘growl,’ 
‘murmur. 
‘meditate,’ 
is 
regularly 
rendered 
by 
μελετῶ, 
xxxviii. 
I4, 
lix. 3, 13 
though 
with 
what 
exact 
meaning 
it 
is 
hard 
to 
say.
ἀνελεῖν 
αὐτοὺς 
πνεύματι 
Mani] 
Heb. 
‘in 
the 
day 
of 
the 
east ’ 
LXX.'
s 
clause 
seems 
a 
madeup 
attempt 
from 
the 
context, 
and 
end 
of 
ver. 7. 
The 
east 
wind 
was 
strong 
(Ps. 
xlviii. 7, 
Ezek. 
xxvii. 26) 
and 
blighting 
(Gen.

εὐλογία. . . 
ὅταν 
άψέλωμαι] 
εὐλογία 
is 
a

interpretation 
of

part 
of 
this 
verse 
with 
lix. 19, 
in 
his 
quotation, 
Rom. 
xi.

Α’
s 
θῶ 
can 
scarcely 
be 
right; 
probably 
assimilated 
to 
ἀφέλωμαι, 
unless 
θῶ 
σύνπαντας

διακεκομμένα] 
The 
correspondence 
between 
Heb. 
and 
Lxx. 
is 
still 
far 
from 
exact, 
and 
this 
word 
seems 
to 
be 
for 711183, 
though 
not 
exactly 
in 
the 
order: 
either 
taking 
the 
word 
in 
its 
primary 
sense 
of 
‘cut 
off' ’ 
(used 
of 
pruning 
or 
cropping, 
or 
possibly 
with 
some 
confusion 
with 
κατακεκομμένουσ).
τὸ 
κατοικούμενον 
and 
ποίμνιον 
might 
either 
of 
them 
render 
ma, 
‘habitation,’ 
but 
more 
probably 
the 
former, 
as 
ποίμνιον 
recurs 
below,  
 and 
may 
be 
an 
insertion 
here: 
ἀνειμένον 
should 
be 
and 
καταλελιμμένον 
the 
second 
ποίμνιον 
is 
‘wilderness' 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
pasture: 
εἷς 
βόσκημα 
seems 
to 
correspond 
to 
‘shall ’ 
καὶ 
ἐκεῖ 
ἀναπαύσονται 
agrees 
nearly 
with 
Heb., 
and 
after 
καὶ 
μετὰ 
χρόνον (?) 
there 
is 
οὐκ 
ἔσται 
ἐν

πᾶν, 
answering 
fairly 
well 
to 
taken 
as 
passive 
or 
intrans., 
‘shall 
be

and 
χλωρὸν 
for 
mayo, 
‘branches’: 
then 
with 
διὰ

ξηρανθῆναι=
original 
and 
version 
converge.
The 
words 
καὶ 
ἔσται 
πολὺν 
χρόνον 
remain 
unaccounted 
for, 
as 
answering 
to 
‘a 
calf.

The 
words 
‘of

The

an 
early 
ﬁg. 
[Theophrastus, 
De 
Cami: 
Plantarum, 
v. 
i. 
πρὶν 
λαβεῖν] 
This 
goes 
a 
little 
beyond 
the 
Heb., 
the 
verb 
being  
 an 
addition 
for 
’s 
sake, 
while 
πρὶν 
ἢ 
suggests 
rather 
than 
Θελήσει] 
This 
periphrasis 
rather 
weakens 
the 
sentence. 
Compare 
with 
it 
μέλλει, 
below, 
ver. 
καταπιεῖν] 
Cf. 
xxv. 8: 
the 
regular 
rendering 
of 
‘swallow,’ 
though 
primarily 
only 
suitable 
in 
the 
case 
of 
liquids.
ὁ 
πλακεὶς] 
Heb. 
‘and 
for 
a 
diadem ’: 
the 
word 
only 
elsewhere 
used 
in 
Ezek. 
vii. 7, 
IO, 
where 
it 
is 
thought 
to 
mean 
‘fate’ 
or 
‘doom,’ 
viewed 
as 
a 
circle, 
cf. 
Shakespeare, 
King 
Lear, 
v. 
iii. 174, 
“The 
wheel 
is 
come 
full 
circle: 
I 
am

καταλειφθήσονται] 
Repeating 
the 
word 
from 
καταληφθέντι 
in 
ver. 5, 
while 
omitting 
‘to 
him 
that 
sitteth.
κωλύων] 
In 
itself, 
apart 
from 
number, 
a 
possible 
translation 
for 
Hiphil 
of 
Lxx. 
however 
have 
omitted 
‘war,’ 
and 
read 
 ‘destroy’ 
(as 
a 
tempest) 
for 
W 
‘gate’: 
unless 
ἀνελεῖν 
is 
a 
general 
guess.
πεπλανημένοι] 
The 
original 
hand 
Of 
B 
reads 
πεπλημμελημένοι, 
In 
Levit. 
v., 
vi., 
c. 
πλημμελεῖν 
translates 
of 
a 
‘trespass’ 
or 
forteitoffering, 
the 
present 
word 
mama) 
being 
represented 
by 
ἀγνοέω. 
and 
found 
in 
close 
conjunction 
with 
the 
other, 
as 
Levit. 
v. 19; 
cf. 
ἀγνόημα, 
Gen. 
xliii. 12. 
In 
Ps. 
cxix. 67, 
ἐπλημμέλησα 
is 
used 
for 
JJW: 
but 
in 
ver. 10 
of 
the 
same 
Psalm, 
the 
causal 
is 
rendered 
by 
ἀπώσῃς 
In 
the 
present 
passage, 
πλανάω 
is 
used 
in 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
verse; 
the 
Heb. 
mainly 
alternating 
between 
two 
verbs, 
while 
Lxx. 
show 
unusual 
variety. 
Either 
Greek 
verb 
is 
a 
possible 
rendering 
of 
the 
Heb., 
except 
that 
the 
perf. 
pass. 
of 
πλημμελέω 
seems 
out 
of 
place, 
and 
would 
rather 
mean 
‘sinned ’ 
as 
it 
does 
not 
appear 
to 
be 
used 
deponently. 
There 
is, 
however, 
little 
in 
its 
favour 
here, 
except 
that 
alteration 
would 
be 
more 
likely 
to 
be 
away 
from 
than 
towards 
it.

the

Hexaplaric, 
though 
not 
so 
recorded 
in 
Q 
mg; 
and 
Lxx. 
must 
have 
inadvertently 
omitted 
them. 
Or 
else 
the 
omission 
was 
made 
by 
the 
Hesychian 
Mss. 
original, 
in 
dealing 
with 
the 
passage. 
In 
itself, 
’s 
text 
seems 
preferable.
φάντασμα] 
So 
A

other 
MSS. 
φάσμα: 
the 
same 
variety 
of 
reading 
in 
Job 
xx. 8. 
Either

read 
as 
This 
verse 
is 
as 
difficult 
to 
reconcile 
with 
the 
Heb. 
as 
any 
in 
Isaiah. 
At 
the 
end 
of 
ver. 7, 
Lxx. 
seem 
to 
have 
omitted 
as 
their  
 fullest 
text 
has 
six 
verbs 
to 
Heb'
s 
seven. 
‘decision' 
then 
corresponds 
in 
place 
to

and 
LXX., 
if 
they 
did 
not 
mistake 
the 
meaning, 
perhaps 
read .154), 
‘a 
curse.' 
might 
have 
been 
read 
as 
‘shall 
eat.' 
(For 
ἀρὰ 
ἔδεται, 
cf. 
xxiv. 
πλεονεξία 
may 
be 
due 
to 
a 
confusion 
of 
‘filth' 
with 
‘mire’ 
and 
‘greed’ 
Ps. 
cxix. 36. 
But 
this 
is 
hardly 
traceable.
ταύτην] 
Grabe 
read 
τρίτην, 
for 
which 
Holmes 
and 
Parsons 
exhibit 
no 
MS. 
authority: 
it 
would 
represent 
Heb. 
read 
for 
’lL’
W’, 
‘tables.’
κακὰ] 
nm 
for 
run 
‘knowledge.
The 
repeated 
ἀνηγγείλαμεν, 
ἀγγελίαν, 
for 
three 
different 
Heb. 
words 
is 
in 
the 
LXX.'
s 
balder 
manner: 
cf. 
ψεῦδος

ver. 15, 
πέπαυται 
in 
xxiv. 7, 
ὄνομα 
ὀνομάζομεν, 
xxvi. 
οἱ 
(broyank] 
Again 
the 
nominative 
appears, 
in 
loose 
connection. 
The 
absence 
of 
caseterminations 
in 
Heb. 
is 
clearly 
the 
cause.
Verse 9 
is 
now 
generally 
taken 
as 
the 
scornful 
question 
of 
’s 
hearers; 
and 
ver. 10 
as 
their 
scoffing 
description 
of 
his 
message, 
retorted 
in 
earnest 
upon 
them 
in 
ver. 
θλίψεν 
ἐπὶ 
θλίψιν 
κ.
τ.
λ.] 
Heb. 
has 
here 
and 
in 
ver. 13 
a 
series 
of 
peculiar 
reiterated 
monosyllables. 
LXX. 
differs 
considerably, 
having 
clearly 
misread 
and 
misunderstood 
several 
words. 
θλίψις 
is 
for 
 ‘precept,’ 
‘command’: 
προσδέχου 
probably 
‘line,’ 
‘rule,’ 
taken 
for 
(or 
at 
any 
rate 
from) 
mp 
‘expect’: 
or 
else 
rips 
‘receive,’ 
for 
 ἐλπὶς 
is 
again, 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
mp: 
cf. 
ver. 17, 
and 
xviii. 1, 
ἔτι. . . 
ἔτι] 
Probably 
intended 
to 
render 
‘here...
there’: 
unless 
it 
be 
a 
corruption 
of 
ἐκεῖ, 
written 
εκι, 
as 
in ℵ*, 
xxii. 18, 
xxiii. 12 
but 
this 
seems 
less 
likely.
Φαυλισμὸν] 
‘stammer,’ 
often 
means 
‘mock’: 
cf. 
xxxiii. 19. 
’s 
suggestion 
of 
τραυλισμόν 
here, 
and 
τετραυλισμένον 
there, 
appears 
therefore 
unnecessary.
πεινῶντι] 
This 
verb 
is 
constantly 
used 
by 
mm. 
of 
‘ωεαρινεσσ 
as 
well 
as 
of 
hunger: 
see 
xl. 30, 31. 
So 
‘starve' 
is 
used 
in 
the 
North 
of 
England 
of 
suffering 
from 
cold 
as 
well 
as 
of 
hunger.
σύντριμμα] 
Heb. 
‘refreshing.’ 
Perhaps 
Lxx. 
misread 
mum, 
and 
took 
it 
from 
m: 
συγκλάσω, 
xlv. 2) 
instead 
of 
The 
form 
nmm 
does 
not 
occur, 
but 
the 
translator 
need 
not 
be 
supposed 
to 
have 
known 
this. 
(The 
word 
has 
various 
developments 
of 
meaning : 
see 
li. 4. 15 
in 
Heb. ; 
but 
σύντριμμα 
cannot 
be 
said 
to 
come 
near 
any 
of 
them.)
κινδυν. 
καὶ 
συντριβήσονται] 
This 
is 
the 
order 
of 
NAQ 
and 
about 
a 
dozen 
cursives, 
mainly 
Hesychian, 
beside 
the 
Luc. 
MSS., 
which 
read 
κινδυνεύσωσιν. 
Β 
has 
συντ. 
καὶ 
κινδυνεύσουσιν, 
in 
agree.  
 ment 
with 
Heb. 
order; 
though 
the 
meaning 
in 
Heb. 
is 
‘be ’ 
not 
‘venture.’
On 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
verse 
see 
above, 
on 
ver. 10. 
λόγιον 
makes 
the 
utterance 
of 
the 
Lord 
more 
special 
and 
formal. 
προσδέχου 
is 
not 
read 
here, 
except 
as 
a 
Hexaplaric 
addition 
(Q 
mg), 
the 
sense 
not 
being 
felt 
to 
require 
a 
verb.
τεθλιμμένοι] 
Heb. 
‘men 
of ’ 1135, 
which 
LXX. 
seem 
to 
have 
read 
as 
from 
again.
συνθήκας] 
Heb. 
word 
for 
‘agreement’ 
generally 
means 
a 
‘vision.’ 
“An—
an 
éclaircissement; 
so 
as 
to 
be 
on 
a 
perfectly 
good 
understanding 
with ” 
(Kay). 
Ἅιδης 
as 
usual 
represents 
sheol.
Lowth 
compares 
Lucan, 
Pizars. 
IX. 891, 897 
“Gens 
unica 
terras
Incolit. * * * 
Pax 
illis 
cum 
morte 
data 
est. 
Fiducia 
tanta 
est
Sanguinis.'
To 
which 
add 
Shakespeare, 
Rich. 
II. 
V. 
i. 20 
(though 
the 
implication 
differs 
“I 
am 
sworn 
brother, 
sweet,
To 
grim 
Necessity, 
and 
he 
and 
I
Will 
keep 
a 
league 
till 
death.'
It 
may 
be 
noticed 
that 
LXX. 
here 
succeeds 
in 
rendering 
the 
Heb. 
parallelism 
by 
a 
change 
of 
compound 
in 
the 
Greek.
φερομένη] 
Cf. 
ver. 2: 
Heb. 
has 
the 
word 
there 
rendered 
by 
συρον.
ψεῦδος] 
Heb. 
has 
parallel 
words 
in 
the 
two 
clauses, 
see 
above 
on 
ver. 
τὴν 
ἐλπίδα] 
Another 
Heb. 
word 
here; 
rendered 
πεποιθότες 
in 
ver. 17, 
closely 
connected 
with 
that 
rendered 
‘trust’ 
in 
xxx. 2, 3 
πεποιθόσιν 
in 
ver. 3, 
perhaps 
merged 
in 
σκεπασθῆναι 
in 
ver. 2. 
Cf. 
Joel 
iii. 16, 
A.
V. 
‘hope,’ 
where 
Lxx. 
φείσεται 
is 
due 
to 
taking 
the 
word 
as 
though 
from 
Ἰδοὺ 
ἐγὼ 
κ.
τ.
λ.] 
Quoted, 
I 
Pet. 
ii. 6, 
and 
also 
in 
a 
compound 
quotation 
with 
viii. 14, 
by 
St 
Paul, 
Rom. 
ix. 33. 
On 
the 
whole, 
both 
quotations 
agree 
with 
Lxx., 
especially 
in 
the 
use 
of 
καταισχύνομαι 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
verse, 
whereas 
Heb. 
has 
‘be 
in ’ 
Peter 
and 
Paul 
both 
have 
τίθημι 
instead 
of 
ἐμβαλῶ 
or 
ἐμβάλλω, 
but 
this 
is 
a 
kind 
of 
variant 
found 
among 
MSS. 
of 
the 
LXX., 
cf. 
e.
g. 
xlix. 6 
and 
Ii. 23, 
with 
their 
variants. 
(It 
is 
sometimes 
suggested 
that 
Peter 
was 
acquainted 
with 
’s 
epistle.) 
There 
are, 
indeed, 
some 
parallel 
cases 
in 
Isaiah  
 to 
this 
discrepancy 
in 
the 
matter 
of 
verbs, 
(a) 
between 
MSS. 
of 
the 
LXX. 
as 
xxxviii. 4 
σώσω 
NAQ, 
ῥύσομαι 
Β, 
xxxiii. 
H, 
lxvi. 14 
(b) 
between 
mat. 
and 
Heb., 
as 
iii. 
to, 
vii. 
Scholz 
suggests 
that 
Lxx. 
read 
τὴν 
for 
ὑπ’, 
which 
seems 
probable: 
Cheyne 
suggested, 
as 
to 
the 
Heb. 
text, 
a 
confusion 
of 
D 
and 
n, 
i.
e. 
from 
’m, 
with 
the 
sense, 
‘shall 
not 
give ’: 
this 
he 
thought 
Lxx. 
rendered 
freely. 
But 
it 
is 
difficult 
to 
see 
what 
is 
gained 
by 
this 
supposition.
The 
force 
of 
‘be 
in ’ 
is 
perhaps 
to 
be 
gathered 
from 
the 
use 
Of 
a 
different 
word 
in 
xxxii. 4, 
xxxv. 4: 
ἀσθενούντων 
and 
ὀλιγόψυχοι 
in 
LXX.
Arm] 
Heb. 
‘line,’ 
cf. 
ver. 10, 13. 
Lxx. 
after 
this 
changes 
the 
construction.
σταθμοὺς] 
As 
near 
as 
possible 
to 
Heb., 
‘weighing’ 
lines, 
cf. 2 
Kings 
xxi. 13 : 
the 
root 
being 
that 
of 
‘shekel,’ 
the 
standard 
weight.
μάτην] 
Perhaps 
for 
‘hail’ : 
cf. 
xxvii. 3. 
See 
below.
ὅτι 
οὗ 
μὴ 
προέλθῃ] 
B 
omits 
οὐ. 
It 
is 
on 
the 
face 
of 
it 
easiest 
to 
regard 
this 
omission 
as 
a 
clerical 
error. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
the 
next 
clause, 
beginning 
ver. 18, 
μὴ 
καὶ 
ἀφέλῃ, 
gives 
some 
support 
to 
B'
s 
text, 
if 
it 
can 
be 
translated. 
The 
use 
of 
μή, 
in 
this 
case, 
appears 
to 
be 
elliptic 
(Goodwin, 
Gr. 
Μ. 
and 
T. § 46, 
Note 4) 
cf. 
Plat. 
Gorgia: 462 
E, 
μὴ 
ἀγροικότερον 
ἦ 
τὸ 
ἀληθὲς 
εἰπεῖν, 
or

ἰσχύῃ. 
See 
also 
the 
Textus 
Receptus 
of 
Rom. 
xi. 21. 
The 
difficulty 
is, 
that 
in 
these 
and 
similar 
passages, 
the 
ellipse 
amounts 
in 
practice 
to 
a 
qualified 
and 
cautious 
assertion, 
whereas 
here 
the 
assertion 
seems 
to 
be 
of 
full 
strength : 
and 
μὴ 
καὶ 
ἀφέλῃ 
is 
not 
necessarily 
the 
same 
construction 
as 
the 
previous 
clause. 
The 
Lxx. 
has 
certainly 
broken 
loose 
to 
some 
extent 
from 
the 
Heb., 
and 
the 
construction 
is 
rather 
broken: 
and 
μὴ 
καὶ 
ἀφέλῃ 
certainly 
seems 
to 
mean, 
‘see 
lest 
it 
take ’ 
Either 
then, 
ὅτι 
οὐ 
μὴ 
παρέλθῃ 
may 
explain 
ψεύδεα 
‘ye 
who 
vainly 
trust 
in 
a 
lying 
idea 
that 
the 
tempest 
will 
not 
pass 
over 
you, 
see 
that 
it 
take 
not 
away...
and 
(certainly) 
your 
hope 
will 
not ’ 
This 
involves 
taking 
παρέλθῃ 
as 
practically 
equivalent 
to 
ἐπέλθῃ, 
which 
is 
not 
free 
from 
objection, 
though 
see 
ver. 15, 19. 
The 
only 
other 
course, 
apparently, 
is 
to 
take 
the 
words 
ὅτι 
οὐ 
μὴ. . . 
ἐμείνῃ 
as 
a 
simple 
parenthesis: 
‘for 
the 
tempest 
shall 
not 
pass 
you 
by: 
take 
heed 
lest 
it 
even 
take 
away 
your 
covenant 
of 
death, 
and, 
&amp;
c.’ 
It 
is 
possible, 
that 
if 
ὅτι 
οὐ 
μὴ 
is 
the 
true 
text, 
the 
scribe 
of 
B 
or 
’s 
predecessor 
might 
have 
dropped 
the 
οὐ, 
under 
the 
influence 
of 
the 
following 
clause.
παρέλθῃ. . . 
καταιγὶς] 
καταιγὶς 
is 
probably 
mum 
read 
as 
a 
noun, 
or 
confused 
with 
ver. 15. 
παρέλθῃ 
seems 
to 
correspond 
to 
 ‘hiding ’ 
akin 
to 
the 
verb 
which 
σκεπασθησόμεθα 
renders 
at 
the 
end 
of 
ver. 15. 
The 
relation 
of 
meaning 
is 
not 
very 
obvious: 
but 
it 
may 
be 
noted 
that 
the 
very 
nDD 
of 
the 
‘Passover' 
is 
rendered 
in 
Ex. 
xii. 13 
σκεπάσω, 
and 
in 
ver. 23 
of 
the 
same 
chapter 
παρελεύσεται.
ἀφέλῃ] 
Heb. 
verb 
is 
passive.
ἐλπὶς] 
Α 
slightly 
varied 
form 
of 
the 
word 
rendered 
συνθήκας 
in 
ver. 15, 
and 
different 
from 
that 
rendered 
ἐλπίδα 
there, 
and 
also 
from 
that 
so 
rendered

Yet 
again 
ἐλπὶς

to 
be 
accounted 
for: 
this

it 
would 
seem 
that

the 
like, 
for 
’p’

‘only 
(Schola’
s 
explanation, 
that 
ἐλπὶς

mm 
for

accounts 
less 
well 
for 
the 
letters, 
except 
that 
it 
keeps 
the 
τ, 
and 
does 
not 
really 
furnish 
any 
correspondence 
to 
the 
meaning 
of 
the 
Greek.)

Heb.

The

changed.
στενοχωρούμενοι] 
The 
Heb. 
of 
this 
verse 
is 
rather 
difficult. 
and 
mac. 
have 
evidently 
failed 
to 
comprehend 
its 
drift. 
This 
first 
word 
of 
the 
Greek 
may 
represent 
the 
Heb. 
‘short,’ 
or 
possibly 
some 
form 
from 
or 
may 
have 
been 
read. 
From 
‘bed,’ 
Lxx. 
may 
have 
guessed 
or 
misread 
‘ﬁght’: 
the 
negative 
is 
very 
likely 
the 
D 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
next 
word; 
δυνάμεθα 
is 
difficult. 
nothing 
at 
all 
resembling 
the 
Heb. 
letters 
having 
this 
meaning, 
and 
in 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
verse 
only 
συναχθῆναι, 
in 
a 
vague 
and 
general 
way, 
has 
the 
same 
meaning 
as 
Heb. 
but 
the 
sense 
of 
the 
clause, 
as 
presented, 
is 
quite 
different. 
ἀσθενοῦμεν 
may 
suggest 
that 
from 
 ‘faint,’ 
was 
read 
for 
but 
this 
is 
too 
remote 
to 
be 
satisfactory.
ἀσεβῶν] 
translates 
’m, 
which 
is 
the 
same 
word 
rendered 
‘ravenous’ 
of 
the 
beasts 
in 
πονηρῶν). 
In 1 
Chron. 
xiv. 1116. 
Baalperazim 
and 
Gibeon 
are 
mentioned 
togetherin 
an 
account 
of 
two 
of 
’s 
battles: 
in 
the 
parallel 
account, 2 
Sam. 
v., 
Heb., 
though 
not 
Lxx., 
has 
Geba : 
but 
the 
two 
places 
were 
only 
a 
few 
miles 
apart.
πικρίας 
ἔργον] 
So 
far 
the 
Heb. 
and 
Greek 
have 
tallied 
fairly 
well 
πικρίας 
however 
differs, 
Heb. 
having 
‘strange’: 
this 
is 
not, 
perhaps, 
beyond 
the 
LXX.'
s 
limit 
of 
free 
translation, 
and 
there 
is 
the 
possibility 
of 
their 
having 
read 
‘haughty’: 
see 
’s 
note 
on 
xxv. 2. 
It 
may 
also, 
however, 
occur 
on 
comparison 
of 
xiv. 9 
ἐπικράνθη), 
that 
πικρία 
may 
be 
due 
to 
some 
confusion 
with 
earlier 
in 
the 
verse 
which 
is 
not 
rendered 
impossible 
by 
the 
rendering 
θυμοῦ 
there, 
as  
 mu. 
has 
been 
found 
to 
render 
one 
Heb. 
word 
by 
two 
Greek 
ones, 
and 
vice 
warm: 
θυμὸς 
in 
this 
very 
verse 
can 
hardly 
stand 
for 
the 
same 
Heb. 
as 
θυμοῦ, 
unless 
the 
confusion 
in 
rendering 
goes 
beyond 
what 
is 
suggested 
in 
this 
and 
the 
next 
note.
ὁ 
δὲ

tank] 
It 
would 
seem 
that 
we 
have 
here 
duplicate 
renderings 
of 
the 
Heb. 
clause, 
‘and 
to 
work 
his

(That 
duplicate

do 
occur 
is 
admitted, 
and 
that 
from 
various 
causes : 
most, 
perhaps, 
being 
Hexaplaric 
renderings 
which 
have 
intruded 
into 
the 
text 
side 
by

with 
the 
true 
Lxx., 
but 
others 
being 
traces 
of 
different 
recensions 
of 
the 
mat. 
itself; 
one 
of 
which, 
in 
some 
cases, 
may 
have 
been 
used 
by 
Theodotion, 
notably 
in 
Daniel, 
while 
the 
other, 
in 
the 
present 
state 
of 
our 
knowledge, 
appears 
as 
the 
genuine 
LXX. 
See 
Vol. 
I. 
Introd. 
pp. 4, 5, 35.) 
That 
the 
thricerepeated 
‘work’ 
of 
Heb. 
is 
represented 
only 
once 
or 
twice 
will 
cause 
no 
surprise, 
after 
what 
we 
have 
seen 
of 
the 
LXX.'
s 
methods.
As 
to 
the 
Greek, 
ἀλλοτρίως 
(a) 
and 
ἀλλοτρία 
ὁ) 
evidently 
represent 
‘alien.’
For 
the 
rest, 
in 
(a) 
θυμὸς 
is 
probably 
mar 
read 
as 
man, 
from 
‘pass 
over,' 
‘exceed,’ 
used 
of 
‘anger,’ 
as 
in 
Gen. 
xlix. 7, 
μῆνις. 
χρήσεται 
is 
either 
a 
colourless 
verb 
to 
complete 
the 
clause, 
or 
is ’ 
intended 
to 
represent 
a 
verbal 
form 
from 
rightly 
read.
In 
(b) 
πικρία 
is 
perhaps 
due 
to 
the 
same 
misreading 
as 
θυμὸς 
in 
(a), 
as 
(Job 
iii. 20) 
is 
rather 
too 
far 
off 
in 
letters 
to 
be 
a 
probable 
misreading. 
’s 
σαπρία 
is 
difficult 
to 
account 
for, 
if 
more 
than 
the 
aberration 
of 
a 
scribe : 
a 
misunderstanding 
of 
πικρία, 
a 
desperate 
attempt 
to 
get 
light 
from 
Joe] 
ii. 20 
or 
Job 
xxi. 25, 26, 
or 
a 
reading 
of 
’nv, 
Joel 
i. 17, 
as 
a 
noun, 
in 
place 
of 
are 
alike 
unsatisfactory 
suggestions, 
and 
only 
mentioned 
in 
the 
hope 
of 
attracting 
the 
notice 
of 
some 
one 
who 
may 
perchance 
solve 
the 
enigma.
It 
is 
curious 
that 
in 
Eph. 
iv. 29, 31, 
πᾶς 
λόγος 
σαπρὸς 
and 
πᾶσα 
πικρία 
stand 
at

from 
’s 
Commentary 
XXL, 
xxu. 
(printed 
in 
foam. 
Iourn. 
Studies, 
July, 1902), 
we 
might 
guess 
at 
some 
confusion 
based 
on 
Joel 
ii. 20 
and 
Isa. 
xxxvii. 
καὶ 
ὑμεῖς 
μὴ 
εὐφρανδάητε] 
ὑμεῖς, 
perhaps 
(by 
error 
of 
sound?) 
for 
‘now’ 
(so 
Scholz). 
εὐφρανθείητε, 1351711 
or 
for 
‘be 
scorners.’
συντετμημένα] 
The 
scribe 
of 
A 
wrote 
συντετελμημενα, 
apparently 
confusing 
the 
word 
with 
the 
participle 
preceding.
This 
verse 
recalls 
x. 22, 23. 
The 
‘destruction 
and 
decision' 
draws 
nearer.
παρὰ] 
See

xxi. 
IO. 
Heb.

in 
ver. 29 
it 
is 
um.
μέλλει. . . 
ἀροτριᾶν] 
So 
nearly 
all 
MSS., 
but 
B 
has 
ἀροτ 
ριάσει 
which 
would 
appear 
to 
be 
Hexaplaric 
(from 
Aq. 
Theod. 
Symm.). 
The 
periphrastic 
future 
phrase 
is 
perhaps 
to 
make 
it 
clear 
that 
μὴ 
is 
interrogative. 
It 
is 
however 
curious 
that 
a 
mistranslation 
in 
xlv. 9 
reproduces 
this 
clause 
as 
given 
in 
B; 
and 
there 
AQ* 26 106 109 305 
omit, 
and 
later 
hands 
have 
obelized 
in 
NB 
the 
superfluous 
words 
ὅλην 
τὴν 
ἡμέραν.
A 
seems 
to 
have 
rearranged 
the 
particles 
in 
this 
verse; 
the 
scribe 
perhaps 
objected 
to 
τότε, 
overlooking 
its 
relation 
to 
ὅταν, 
and 
thinking 
it 
did 
not 
suit 
the 
first 
sowing 
described. 
Similarly, 
not 
seeing 
that 
the 
sentence 
was 
interrogative, 
he 
cancelled 
the 
οὐχ. 
In 
this 
point 
the 
Luc. 
MSS. 
agree 
with 
A: 
but 
otherwise, 
the 
Mss 
generally 
are 
united 
against 
it. 
The 
omission 
of 
the 
second 
σπείρει 
may 
be 
intended 
to 
harmonise 
with 
the 
other 
changes, 
or 
be 
simply 
accidental.
μελάνθιον. . . 
κύμινον] 
‘Fennel,’ 
or 
rather 
‘black 
cummin,' 
and 
‘cummin,’ 
plants 
producing 
small 
seeds, 
used, 
like 
carraway 
seeds, 
for 
flavouring. 
The 
former, 
Nzlgella 
saliva, 
seems 
to 
have 
no 
more 
distinctive 
name 
in 
English. 
Kay 
calls 
it 
‘anise,’ 
and 
Lowth 
‘dill, 
neither 
of 
which 
is 
exact, 
though 
these 
plants 
are 
near 
akin.

occurs 
here

it

its

the

then 
answers, 
but 
incorrectly, 
to

which 
is 
an 
imperfect 
(future) 
tense 
in 
Heb. 
The 
μετὰ 
betrays 
that 
something 
is 
wrong. 
It 
is 
possible, 
however, 
that 
LXX. 
guessed 
at 
the 
sense, 
and 
meant 
μετὰ 
ἄρτου 
to 
render 
‘with 
a 
staff,' 
according 
to 
the 
familiar 
saying: 
though 
the 
word 
is 
not 
but 
Ipr 
in 
iii. 1, 
and 
nor: 
in 
Lev. 
xxvi. 26, 
Ps. 
cv. 16, 
Ezek. 
iv. 16, 
c. 
In 
that 
case 
nnS 
may 
have 
been 
taken 
as 
a 
verb, 
and 
the 
following 
word 
omitted: 
or 
coupled, 
as 
in 
the 
passages 
quoted, 
with 
‘staff.’
ἐγὼ. . . 
ὀργισθήσομαι] 
The 
person 
is 
changed 
to 
Ist, 
doubtless 
because 
the 
verb 
here 
contains 
an 
initial 
R, 
the 
form 
being 
more 
familiar.
φωνὴ 
τῆς 
πικρίας] 
φωνὴ 
is 
‘driveth,' 
read 
as 
some 
form, 
or 
(xiv. 
II), 
from 
πικρίας 
corresponds 
in 
place 
to 
‘his ’ 
urchin, 
and 
it 
is 
just 
possible 
that 
the 
sense 
of 
Ebb 
'stingeth' 
(Prov. 
xxiii. 32) 
was 
thought 
of, 
Lxx. 
harping 
on 
the 
word 
πικρία 
after 
their 
manner.
ματαίαν 
παράκλησιν] 
Syntax 
differs, 
but 
rootmeanings 
of 
words 
agree, 
until 
the 
end 
of 
the 
verse: 
ὑψώσατε 
corresponds 
to 
‘maketh ’ 
to 
which 
verb 
it 
is 
used 
as 
a 
parallel 
in 
i. 2, 
xxiii. 4. 
The 
last 
word 
in 
the 
Heb. 
verse 
is 
probably 
meaning 
‘wisdom' 
of 
which 
Lxx. 
possibly 
made 
nip 
inn, 
‘vanity 
of ’ 
or 
‘of 
speech' 
the 
word 
is 
paraphrased 
in 
Job 
vii. 13 
by 
ἀνοίσω) 
ἰδίᾳ 
λόγον, 
apparently 
parallel 
in 
intention 
to 
παρακαλέσει. 
Or, 
if 
Lxx. 
misread  
 the 
word 
as 
’n, 
they 
may 
have 
connected 
it 
with 
MW. 
‘vanity,’ 
and 
supplied 
one 
of 
their 
favourite 
ideas 
in 
παράκλησιν 
(cf. 
xxx. 
The 
turn 
of 
phrase 
in 
the 
Greek 
reminds 
us 
of 
Judg. 
xix. 30, 
xx. 7 
but 
it 
seems 
to 
be 
merely 
coincidence.
XXIX. 1. 
πόλις 
Ἀριὴλ] 
The 
Lxx. 
does 
not 
repeat 
‘Ariel.’ 
B, 
with 
most 
MSS., 
keeps 
the 
Heb. 
order 
of 
words.
The 
meaning 
of 
‘Ariel’ 
is 
generally 
held 
to 
be 
either 
‘lion 
of 
God. 
or 
‘hearth 
of 
God,' 
i.
e. 
altarhearth, 
where 
a 
ﬁre 
burns, 
a 
kindred 
word 
occurring 
in 
Ezek. 
xliii. 15, 16. 
The 
word 
is 
obscure: 
but 
it 
may 
be 
taken 
as 
certain 
that 
the 
reference 
is 
to 
Jerusalem.
ἦν 
Δαυεὶδ 
ἐπολέμησεν] 
Heb. 
‘where 
D. 
camped’: 
quam 
’t 
David, 
Vulg. 
It 
is 
doubtful 
whether 
this 
camping 
of 
David 
was 
for 
attack 
or 
defence: 
most 
modems 
think 
the 
latter, 
but 
Kay 
and 
Prof. 
W. 
E. 
Barnes 
the 
former, 
referring 
to 2

v. 6, 
συναγάγετε 
γενήματα] 
Taking 
the 
verb 
wrongly 
from 
‘gather’ 
instead 
of 
‘add,’ 
Lxx. 
lost 
its 
direct 
connection 
with 
‘year 
to 
year, 
and 
supplied 
γενήματα.
φάγεσθε 
γὰρ 
σὺν 
Μωάβ] 
This 
strange 
phrase 
bears 
no 
resemblance 
to 
Heb., 
except 
the 
connection 
between 
Φαγέσθε 
and 
‘feasts.’ 
The 
Luc. 
MSS. 
supply 
a 
Hexaplaric 
rendering, 
ἑορταὶ 
συγκρουσθήσονται 
and 
the 
LXX. 
text 
doubtless 
professes 
to 
translate 
these 
same 
words. 
The 
Old 
Latin 
is 
here 
extant 
in 
the 
VViirzburg 
fragment, 
beginning 
with 
the 
words 
manducate 
’tz’:

This 
supports 
’s 
text 
which 
repeats 
φάγεσθε; 
so 
also 
does 
’s 
rendering 
of 
the 
Lxx.: 
and 
it 
is 
noteworthy 
that 
both 
treat 
the 
ﬁrst 
φάγεσθε 
as 
imperative. 
Of 
this 
imperat. 
middle 
there 
are 
some 
possible 
instances 
elsewhere 
in 
Lxx., 
e.
g. 
xxxvii. 30, 
but 
perhaps 
none 
which 
are 
certainly 
imperative.
As 
to 
σὺν 
Μωάβ, 
there 
are 
two 
questions. 
What 
is 
the 
meaning 
or 
reference? 
Is 
it 
the 
original 
Lxx. 
text? 
To 
the 
ﬁrst, 
several 
attempts 
at 
an 
answer 
might 
be 
made, 
but 
none 
certain 
or 
convincing. 
It 
might 
be 
a 
reference 
to 
’s 
parents, 
sojourning 
for 
safety 
in 
Moab; 1 
Sam. 
xxii. 3; 
or 
to 
Elimelech 
and 
his 
family, 
taking 
refuge 
there 
from 
famine: 
Ruth 
i. 
I: 
or 
generally, 
in 
reference 
to 
these 
and 
other 
possible 
episodes 
(cf. 
xvi. 3, 4), 
meaning 
‘you 
shall 
be 
reduced 
to 
seek 
food 
at 
’s ’ 
But 
there 
is 
nothing 
to 
show 
what 
the 
translator, 
or 
the 
ﬁrst 
writer, 
of 
these 
words 
intended.
Secondly, 
is 
the 
Greek 
text 
right? 
The 
error, 
if 
there 
be 
one, 
is 
clearly 
shown 
to 
be 
old, 
by 
the 
O.
L. 
and 
the 
agreement 
of 
the 
MSS., 
except 
as 
regards 
φάγεσθε. 
Yet 
this 
evidence 
does 
not 
exclude 
early 
corruption: 
and 
σὺν 
Μωὰβ 
is 
unintelligible, 
especially 
as 
a 
duplicate  
 of 
συνκρουσθήσονται. 
Can 
some 
such 
adjective 
as 
συμβωμὰ 
have 
been 
corrupted? 
‘ye 
shall 
eat ’ 
might 
not 
be 
too 
remote 
for 
a 
paraphrase 
or 
guess, 
and 
as 
βωμὸς 
is 
not 
the 
usual 
Lxx. 
word 
for 
‘altar,’ 
the 
unusual 
word 
would 
be 
prone 
to 
disappear. 
(In 
Isaiah 
βωμὸς 
occurs 
only 
in 
xv. 2, 
xvi. 12, 
xvii. 8, 
xxvii.

and 
a 
passage 
which 
bears 
more 
resemblance,

foll. 
“Ut

‘his

probably 
due 
to 
misreadings

the 
time 
of

The 
converse 
error 
occurs 
in

ὥς 
ὁ 
πίνων] 
The 
article 
is 
omitted 
by 
ℵ*BQ 26 49 104 109 198 306 309. 
In 
that 
case 
the 
construction 
resembles 
the 
use 
of 
Lat. 
tamquam, 
frequent 
in 
Tacitus: 
e.
g. 
Annals 111. 12, 
“differri

‘the

&amp;
c.: 
XML 20, 
“Burrum

Agrippinae 
provectum.'
εἰς 
κενὸν 
ἤλπισεν] 
Heb. 
‘craveth’; 
Lxx. 
seem 
to 
have 
misread, 
rather 
than 
paraphrased, 
perhaps ‘ 
for 
vanity, 
and 
mp 
‘hope,’ 
‘wait’: 
i.
e. 
nmp 
for 
nppiw. 
(mpw 
is 
hardly 
near 
enough 
to 
the 
meaning.)
Shortened 
and 
paraphrased 
in 
Lxx. 
Heb. 
begins 
the 
verse 
with 
two 
pairs 
of 
verbs, 
the 
first 
of 
each 
a 
reflexive 
form, 
and 
either 
from 
the 
same 
root, 
or 
one 
connected 
with 
the 
second 
verb, 
or 
else 
used 
with 
a 
play 
on 
words 
and 
different 
meaning: 
the 
former 
alternative 
seems 
the 
more 
likely: 
‘Astonish 
yourselves, 
and 
be 
astonished: 
blind 
yourselves, 
and 
be ’ 
(otherwise 
(most 
probably) 
‘Tarry, 
and 
be 
astonished: 
take 
your 
pleasure, 
and 
be 
blind!'), 
Vulg. 
has 
’te, 
εἰ 
’ramz’
m’, 
ﬂuctuate, 
et 
uacillate.
It 
seems 
that 
Lxx. 
have 
attempted 
to 
translate 
the 
first 
pair 
only: 
the 
second 
being 
supplied, 
with 
variants, 
by 
the 
Luc. 
MSS. 
from 
the 
Hexapla 
(Symmachus). 
Their 
rendering, 
ἐκλύθητε 
καὶ 
Exams, 
resembles 
the 
treatment 
of 
a 
similarly 
obscure 
pair 
of 
verbs 
in 
Zeph. 
ii. 1, 
συνάχθητε 
καὶ 
συνδέθητε, 
Vulg. 
conuenite, 
congregamini 
which 
looks 
as 
though 
Jerome, 
and 
perhaps 
Lxx. 
also, 
regarded 
the 
verbs 
here 
as 
cognate 
pairs.
Scholz 
marks 
et 
uacillate; 
inebriamini, 
as 
an 
addition 
to 
the 
Heb. 
(Zusatz 
zum

Texte); 
but 
whether 
this 
means 
an 
omission 
on 
the 
part 
of 
mm. 
or 
not, 
it 
hardly 
seems 
to 
represent 
the 
facts 
of 
the 
case.

identical 
in

apparently 
means

Justin 
Martyr 
(Tryph. 27, 78) 
also 
supports 
the 
shorter 
text, 
and 
Clement 
of 
Rome 
(Ep. 
ad 
Cor.

Irenaeus 
(IV.

and 
Clement 
of 
Alexandria 
(Paed. 1. 76) 
are 
at 
any 
rate 
not 
against 
it. 
In 
fact, 
the 
shorter 
text, 
as 
’ven 
by 
RAQ, 
may 
be 
regarded 
as 
pretty 
certainly 
right 
for 
the 
Lxx.; 
though, 
as 
Mr 
Burkitt 
again 
points 
out, 
some 
confusion 
appears 
at 
ﬁrst 
sight 
in 
estimating 
the 
evidence 
of 
the 
Fathers, 
because 
it 
is 
sometimes 
doubtful 
whether 
they 
are 
not 
quoting 
from 
the 
Gospels: 
where, 
in 
Matthew, 
most 
MSS., 
headed 
by 
CΔΦ 
have 
the 
longer 
text, 
though 
RBDL 33 
have 
the 
shorter, 
which 
the  
 principal 
editors 
(and 
RV.) 
approve: 
in 
Mark 
the 
evidence 
is 
all 
for 
the 
shorter 
form, 
and 
indeed 
for 
the 
further 
omission 
of 
ἐγγίζει 
μοι, 
which 
Dr 
Hatch 
supported: 
these 
words, 
however, 
though 
they 
might 
be 
omitted 
in 
quotations 
(as 
by 
St 
Cyprian), 
under 
the 
inﬂuence 
of 
the 
Gospels, 
must 
certainly 
stand 
in

and 
Jerome. 
The 
reading 
of 
A 
&amp;
c. 
is 
nearer 
the 
Heb. 
It 
is 
however 
over 
full, 
suggesting 
a 
duplicate 
rendering, 
or 
an 
addition 
based 
on 
xxx. 
ἢ 
ἃ. 
ἡμεῖς 
ποιοῦμεν] 
Heb. 
has 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
ver. 16 
‘Your 
perverseness’ 
or ‘ 
subversion’ 
of 
things. 
The 
present 
Greek 
is 
superfluous, 
and 
looks 
like 
an 
addition 
or 
explanation. 
Possibly 
the 
real 
LXX. 
has 
dropped 
out, 
or 
been 
corrupted: 
ἡ 
ἀηθεία 
ὑμῶν 
suggests 
itself, 
but 
Lxx. 
are 
hardly, 
perhaps, 
likely 
to 
have 
written 
this, 
and 
scribes 
would 
have 
been 
apt 
to 
turn 
it 
into 
ἀλήθεια.
Cf. 
xlv. 9, 
Jerem. 
xviii. 4—6, 
Rom. 
ix. 21 :

οὐκέτι] 
To

taken 
as 
two 
words 
ε 
Ζ 
reads 
οὐχὶ 
ἔτι.
Χερμὲλ] 
Not 
taken 
here 
as 
a 
proper 
name 
by 
A.
V.; 
the 
word 
Carmel 
means 
‘garden’ 
or ‘ 
orchardland’: 
applied, 
probably, 
in 
this 
sense 
both 
to 
the 
district 
of 
Judah 
and 
the 
hill 
overlooking 
the 
Medi-
 in 
some 
MSS. 
here: 
Καρμήλιον 
in 1 
Kings 
xviii. 19, 
2o, 
λος 
in 42. 
See 
also 
xxxii. 15, 
οἱ 
ὃν 
τῷ 
σκότει] 
Heb. 
has 
‘from’ 
in 
this 
and 
the 
parallel 
phrase : 
Lxx. 
may 
have 
read 3 
for 
D. 
ὀφθαλμοὶ 
τυφλῶν] 
lt 
strains 
the 
Greek 
to 
make 
the 
preceding 
article 
refer 
directly 
to 
ὀφθαλμοῖς 
but 
the 
phrase 
is, 
as 
far 
as 
the 
Creek 
is 
concerned, 
made 
to 
take 
up 
οἱ 
ἐν 
σκότει, 
κ.
τ.
λ., 
as 
though 
an 
ampler 
equivalent 
for 
τυφλοί.
Cf. 
Luke 
vii. 22. 
Between 
ὄψονται 
and 
βλέψονται, 
the 
evidence 
seems 
in 
favour 
of 
the 
former : 
B 
is 
here 
supported 
by 
κ’ 
and 
all 
MSS. 
except 
AQ 24 26 86 106 (239 306). 
Cypr. 
Test. 1. 4 
has 
’debunt.
Lxx. 
treats 
this 
verse 
rather 
loosely.
ἀπηλπισμένοι] 
Either 
‘those 
that 
are 
despaired ’ 
or 
‘that 
are 
driven 
to 
ἄνομος] 
See 
ver. 5 
καταδυναστευόντων), 
XXV. 
οἱ 
άνομοῦντες] 
Heb. 
has 
here 
‘watchers,’ 
which 
LXX. 
perhaps 
read 
as 
participle 
of 
‘act 
act 
falsely.' 
(lix. 13 
fin., 
ἀδίκους.)
τοὺς 
ἐλέγχοντας 
ἂν 
πύλαις] 
Cf. 
Amos 
v. 10; 
the 
phrase 
seems 
to 
be 
used 
of 
them 
that 
stand 
up 
for 
justice. 
Lxx. 
place 
it 
here 
in 
apposition 
to 
πρόσκομμα, 
instead 
of 
dat. 
of 
person 
concerned.
καὶ 
ἐπλαγίασαν] 
B 
reads 
ὅτι 
for 
ml; 
which 
looks 
like 
an 
attempt 
to 
smooth 
the 
connection, 
on 
a 
wrong 
understanding.
ἄν 
ἀδίκοις] 
Heb. 
‘with 
emptiness' 
(tohu). 
Words 
for 
‘vanity, 
‘emptiness,’ 
have 
often 
a 
bad 
sense 
attached: 
cf. 
v. 18, 
Ps. 
xxvi. 4 
mi. 6, 
ἃς. 
The 
present 
instance. 
however, 
is 
not 
easy 
to 
parallel.
ὃν 
ἀφώρισεν 
ἐξ 
Ἀβραὰμ] 
The 
notion 
of 
the 
Heb. 
me, 
‘redeem, 
does 
apparently 
include 
‘separation.’ 
Cf. 
Ps. 
cvi. 
lo, 
and 
Exod. 
viii. 23, 
where 
the 
text 
has 
however 
been 
suspected, 
and 
where 
Lxx. 
render 
the 
noun 
me 
by 
διαστολή. 
Α 
confusion 
with 
is 
possible, 
but 
not 
necessary 
to 
suppose.
μεταβαλεῖ] 
Heb. 
‘be 
white,' 
i.
e. 
pale. 
The 
syntax 
is 
changed: 
and 
many 
MSS. 
(but 
not 
B) 
insert 
Ἰσραήλ, 
probably 
with 
an 
idea 
of 
balancing 
the 
clauses 
as 
in 
the 
following 
verse.
τὰ 
ἔργα 
μου] 
Heb. 
‘the 
work 
of 
my 
ἁγιάσουσιν] 
’s 
ἁγιάσωσιν 
seems 
to 
be 
a 
case 
of 
wrong 
assimilation 
to 
the 
previous 
verb 
ἴδωσιν.
ἱ 
τῷ 
πν. 
πλανεόμενος] 
Β 
has 
πλανώμενοι 
τῷ 
πνεύματι, 
agreeing 
with 
Heb. 
in 
order 
and 
absence 
of 
the 
article: 
the 
definiteness 
in 
Heb. 
being 
due 
to 
the 
construct 
state. 
The 
Greek 
of 
’s 
text 
has 
presumably 
been 
touched 
up : 
but 
nearly 
all 
cursives 
agree 
with 
them.
ὑπακούειν] 
Heb. 
literally 
‘receiving,’ 
but 
used 
specially 
of 
instruction. 
καὶ 
αἰ 
γλῶσσαι. . . 
εἰρήνην] 
The 
only 
reasonable 
explanation 
of 
these 
words, 
not 
in 
the 
Heb., 
and 
marked 
as 
doubtful 
in 
BQ, 
is 
that 
they 
have 
intruded 
from 
xxxii. 4 
(where 
A* 
omits 
ταχύ). 
The 
presence 
of 
μαθήσονται 
in 
the 
balancing 
clause, 
and 
the 
ending 
of 
the 
previous 
clause 
with 
ἀκούειν 
in 
both 
passages, 
are 
the 
only 
apparent 
reasons 
to 
tempt 
the 
scribe 
to 
the 
insertion.
XXX. 
Specially 
against 
alliance 
with 
Egypt.
I. 
συνθήκας] 
Heb. 
has 
a 
very 
obscure 
phrase, 
with 
difficult 
verb 
and 
its 
noun: 
‘weave 
a 
web' 
(Cheyne), 
‘cover 
with 
a 
covering' 
(A.
V., 
R.
V. 
text) 
or 
‘pour 
a 
libation' 
(Gesenius). 
Lxx. 
omits 
the 
verb : 
its 
rendering 
may 
be 
from 
the 
meaning 
‘libation,’ 
or 
from 
some 
senses 
of 
the 
verb 130, 
which 
is 
kindred 
to 
in 
some 
of 
its 
meanings 
at 
least.
προσθεῖναι. . . 
ἁμαρτίαις] 
Cf. 
Ecclus. 
iii. 27, 
v. 
ἐμὲ] 
Heb. 
‘my 
mouth.
βοηθηθῆναι. . . 
σκεπασθῆναι] 
Each 
infinitive 
expresses 
a 
Heb. 
phrase, 
shortened 
into 
one 
idea: 
the 
Heb. 
words 
are 
differently 
rendered 
in 
the 
next 
verse.
σκέπη] 
Heb. 
'stronghold' 
(xxiii. 4, 
H, 
τοῖς 
πεποιθόσιν] 
Heb. 
‘trust,’ 
‘conﬁdence.’ 
‘Shadow’ 
is 
omitted, 
prob. 
because 
of 
the 
paraphrasing 
above.
Τάνις=
Ζοαn, 
see 
xix. 
II.
πονηροί· 
μάτην 
κοπιάσουσιν] 
Heb. 
‘have 
reached 
Hanes,' 
 mm, 
which 
Lxx. 
read 
as 
mn 
‘will 
labour 
to 
weariness 
in ’ 
(so 
Delitzsch). 
Scholz 
thinks 
they 
read 
om 
wrongly 
twice, 
the 
ﬁrst 
time 
as 
Dan 
‘violence’; 
and 
hence 
πονηροί. 
(Perhaps 
cpn, 
which 
is 
however 
generally 
ἄνομος, 
ἀνομέω, 
in 
Isaiah : 
ix. 
I7, 
x. 6, 
xxxii. 6,

Job 
viii.

See 
Hatch, 
Essays 
in 
Bibl. 
Greek,

Lxx. 
having 
thus 
obtained 
a 
verb 
for 
ver. 5, 
omit 
‘(all)

be 
ashamed.
ἐρήμῳ] 
Heb. 
Negeb 
(xxi. 
I).
Ἐν 
τῇ 
θλίψει] 
LXX. 
omit 
‘land,’ 
‘shoulder,' 
and 
‘their 
treasures 
on 
the 
bunches 
of...’
ἔκγονα 
ἀσπίδων 
πετομένων] 
Cf. 
xi. 8, 
xiv. 29: 
the 
latter 
passage 
perhaps 
explains 
the 
introduction 
of 
ἔκγονα, 
which 
is 
otherwise 
superfluous: 
cf. 
the 
regular 
Heb. 
‘daughters 
of 
the 
B* 
omits 
πετομένων.
οἳ] 
The 
relative 
may 
sometimes 
be 
supplied 
in 
translating 
Heb.; 
but 
it 
gives 
no 
improvement 
here.
πρὸς 
ἔθνος] 
All 
versions 
and 
authorities 
agree 
in 
rendering 
‘to’ 
but 
the 
preposition 
is 
the 
same 
as 
the 
previous 
‘on,’ 
and 
seems 
at 
least 
to 
hint 
at 
the 
dependence 
against 
which 
the 
prophet 
inveighs.
ὠφελήσει 
αὐτοὺς] 
Here 
NAOQ 26 41 49 86 87 91 97 106 198 228 233 309 
repeat 
εἷς 
βοήθειαν. . . 
ὄνειδος 
from 
ver. 5. 
It 
is 
clearly 
an 
inadvertence, 
but 
the 
attestation 
should 
be 
studied: 
it 
seems 
to 
be 
mainly 
Hesychian. 
Syrohex. 
has 
it 
in 
the 
margin.
μάταια, 
καὶ 
κενὰ] 
Cf. 
Clem. 
Rom. 
Ερ. 
αd 
Cor. 
i. 7), 
κενὰς 
καὶ 
ματαίας.
ὑμᾶς] 
for 
‘therefore.
ἀπάγγειλον] 
Heb. 
has 
perf. 
I 
pers. 
sing.
ματαία 
ἦ 
παράκλησις 
ὑμῶν 
αὕτη] 
For 
the 
Greek, 
cf. 
xxviii. 29, 
but 
there 
is 
no 
resemblance 
in 
the 
Heb. 
of 
the 
two 
passages. 
Here 
the 
Heb. 
is 
obscure: 
but 
there 
is 
general 
agreement 
among 
modems, 
that 
Rahab 
is 
a 
name 
applied 
to 
Egypt, 
meaning 
‘arrogance’ 
or 
the 
like; 
Ii. 9, 
Ps. 
lxxxvii. 4, 
lxxxix. 
lo 
ὑπερήφανον). 
But 
Rallab 
seems 
also 
to 
have 
stood 
for 
a 
seamonster, 
Job 
ix. 
I3, 
xxvi. 12 
τὸ 
κῆτος); 
and 
it 
appears 
thus 
in 
parallelism 
to 
stand 
for 
the 
sea 
itself. 
As 
the 
monster, 
perhaps, 
cf. 
xxvii. 
I, 
it 
stands 
for 
Egypt : 
the 
great 
unwieldy 
river 
power, 
Ezek. 
xxix. 
This 
however 
brings 
us 
no 
nearer 
to 
the 
Lxx. 
rendering: 
ματαιότητας 
appears 
to 
render 
mam 
‘the 
proud' 
in 
Ps. 
xl. 4: 
παράκλησις 
may 
be 
a 
guess 
(see 
above, 
on 
xxi. 2, 
c.) 
or 
on 
may 
have 
been 
read 
as 
αὕτη 
is 
out 
of 
its 
order, 
but 
in 
a 
sentence 
like 
this 
the 
Greek 
might 
have 
been 
arranged: 
while 
‘sitting 
still’ 
would 
seem 
to 
have 
been 
transferred 
to 
the 
next 
verse, 
καθίσας, 
and 
‘go,' ’ 
which 
seemed 
to 
contradict 
it, 
disappeared, 
or 
was 
rendered 
as 
merely 
hortatory 
by 
οὖν.
The 
Syriac 
(Peshitta) 
has 
here 
‘uain 
is 
this 
your 
confidence' 
(see 
editorial 
note 
in 
journal 
of 
Theol. 
’cs, 
January 1903, 
p. 270): 
which 
certainly 
comes 
very 
near 
to 
the 
Lxx., 
however 
arrived 
at.
καὶ 
εἰς 
βίβλων] 
Lxx., 
as 
frequently, 
omits 
the 
second 
(parallel) 
verb.
καιρῶν] 
‘Occasions,’ 
which 
in 
this 
case 
are 
future. 
Καιρὸς 
is 
not 
usually 
put 
for 
‘the 
day 
of 
the 
Lord,' 
or 
‘In 
that 
day,’ 
though 
see 
xviii. 7 : 
and 
in 
viii. 22 
it 
may 
have 
been 
similarly 
meant; 
there 
is 
a 
sense 
of 
crisis 
ἦ 
ἀπορίη 
ἔχει 
καιρόν 
τινά, 
Aristotle, 
Metaph. 
VII. 
iii. 7). 
The 
Hebrew 
here 
has 
not 
this 
meaning, 
but 
merely 
‘an 
after 
day, 
used 
generally. 
B 
with 
Luc. 
MSS. 
reads 
καιρῷ, 
placing 
it 
after 
ταῦτα, 
but 
this 
hardly 
improves 
matters; 
it 
may 
be 
a 
misunderstanding 
of 
but 
in 
that 
case 
‘after’ 
would 
be 
left 
untranslated.
εἰς 
τὸν 
αἰῶνα] 
MSS. 
generally 
perfix 
ἕως, 
but 
A 
omits 
it. 
Heb. 
 occurs 
twice: 
it 
may 
mean, 
according 
to 
the 
pointing, 
‘until,’ 
as 
in 
the 
second 
place: 
or 
‘perpetuity,’ 
then 
῾for ᾿: 
or, 
‘a ’ 
which 
some 
authorities 
prefer: 
so 
R.
V. 
marg., 
and 
Vulg. 
in 
testimonium 
usque 
ad 
aetermmz. 
LXX. 
seem 
to 
have 
represented 
the 
ﬁrst, 
omitting 
as 
ἕως, 
which 
A 
omits, 
and 
the 
second 
in 
combination 
with 
by 
εἷς 
αἰῶνα; 
but 
their 
accuracy 
is 
scarcely 
to 
be 
trusted, 
as 
these 
Heb. 
words 
occur 
in 
very 
varied 
combinations. 
As 
some 
Luc. 
MSS. 
insert 
εἷς 
μαρτύριον, 
the 
ordinary 
Lxx. 
text 
may 
be 
omitting 
’ly’) 
altogether.
Μὴ 
ἀναγγέλλετε] 
Heb. 
has 
‘see,’ 
cognate 
with 
‘seers.’ 
LXX. 
may 
have 
read 
for 
man.
The 
rest 
of 
the 
verse 
seems 
confused: 
τὰ 
ὁράματα 
ὁρῶσιν 
seems 
to 
take 
up 
the 
two 
cognate 
words 
‘have ’ 
and 
λαλεῖτε 
is 
inserted 
(or 
substituted 
for 
‘have ’ 
in 
the 
second 
place) 
to 
suit 
the 
supposed 
sense. 
The 
best 
MSS. 
omit 
‘right ’ 
and ᾿ 
smooth ᾿; 
Luc. 
MSS. 
have 
ὀρθῶς, 
and 
other 
insertions 
λαλιάν, 
δόλια, 
c.).
ἑτέραν 
πλάνησιν] 
The 
order 
of 
words 
seems 
to 
forbid 
supposing 
that 
ἑτέραν 
represents 
‘right ’ 
read 
as 
mm: 
‘strange,’ 
‘alien.’ 
πλάνησιν 
is 
one 
of 
LXX.'
s 
favourite 
ideas, 
and 
the 
verb 
is 
used 
freely 
to 
express 
their 
interpretation 
of 
ver. 20, 21; 
here 
it 
is 
near 
the 
meaning, 
but 
῾visions᾿ 
is 
omitted.
ἀποστρέψατε. . 
.ἀφέλετε. . 
.ἀφέλετε] 
Heb. 
has 
two 
former 
verbs 
intransitive: 
the 
third 
is 
trans., 
but 
not 
the 
same 
as 
the 
second: 
it 
is 
in 
fact 
the 
causal 
of 
the 
verb 
to 
which 
‘sitting ’ 
in 
ver. 7 
belongs.
τὸ 
λόγιον] 
If 
this 
is 
not 
a 
corruption 
of 
τὸν 
ἅγιον 
(which 
Grabe 
printed, 
see 
below), 
it 
must 
be 
an 
interpretation, 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
the 
‘oracle’ 
or 
place 
where 
answers 
were 
given 
to 
inquiries 
made 
of 
the 
Lord. 
Comparing 
Levit. 
xvi. 3, 16, 33 
with 1 
Kings 
vi. 5 
c., 
vii. 49 
the 
‘Holy 
of ’ 
of 
the 
Tabernacle 
had, 
corresponding 
to 
it 
in 
’s 
Temple, 
the 
‘oracle’ ‘31, 
differing 
by 
and 
pointing 
from 
a 
῾word.᾿ 
LXX. 
in 
Kings 
transliterate, 
δαβὶρ 
or 
δαβείρ. 
In 
this 
case, 
the 
drift, 
according 
to 
LXX., 
differs 
from 
Heb. 
‘This’ 
‘this 
path,: 
seem 
to 
mean 
the 
ﬁxed 
religion 
of 
Judah, 
and 
τὸ 
λόγιον 
its 
hallowed 
place.
τὸν 
ἅγιον 
seems 
to 
have 
no 
MS. 
authority, 
unless 
the 
Slavonic 
version 
be 
counted: 
but 
the 
Lucianic 
cursives 
generally 
read

Not 
the

as 
in 
ver. 9, 
or 
xxviii. 15 
but 
‘oppression’ 
(Ps.

or 
‘fraud.’ 
Some 
wish 
to 
transpose 
two 
letters 
of 
Heb., 
and 
read 
‘perverseness’: 
but 
LXX. 
though 
quoted 
in 
support 
of 
this, 
is 
not 
perceptibly 
nearer 
to 
it

paraphrases

some 
extent, 
and 
introduces 
an 
unwarranted 
idea 
in 
ἑαλωκυίας: 
τεῖχος 
corresponds 
in 
place 
to 
‘breach,’ 
perhaps 
because 
the 
translators 
hesitated 
at 
the 
halfabstract 
idea: 
πόλεως· 
corresponds 
to 
῾wall,’ 
ὀχυρᾶς

to 
‘high’

the

The

the

The 
coupling 
of 
an 
adj. 
and 
subst. 
in 
this 
way 
is 
unusual. 
Tacitus 
is 
alone 
among 
ancient 
stylists 
in 
his 
deliberate 
practice 
of 
coupling 
dissimilar 
words 
and 
phrases: 
see 
Holbrooke, 
Annals 
of 
Tacitus, 
lntrod. § 55. 
Instances 
are 
Arm. 1. 55 
“quo 
crimina

innoxios

VI. 30, 
“eﬁ’

III. 4 
“modo

modo

τόπον 
πίονα] 
For 
the 
Greek, 
cf. 
v. 
I. 
Here 
it 
apparently 
translates 
ΑΒΒREV 
‘pasture,’ 
which 
seems 
to 
carry 
with 
it 
an 
implication 
of 
richness.
ἄχυρα] 
Usually

Delitzsch 
on

barley 
or 
the 
like, 
mixed 
with 
chopped 
straw; 
but 
here 
it 
is 
the 
pure 
grain.” 
The 
original 
meaning 
of 
the 
Heb. 
seems 
to 
be 
‘mixture’: 
the 
quality 
of 
which 
would 
doubtless 
vary 
according 
to 
circumstances.
ἀναπιποιημένα] 
More 
general 
than 
Heb. 
‘salted,’ 
perhaps 
with 
saltflavoured 
herbs.
ἐν 
κριθῇ] 
Scholz 
explains 
this 
as 
due 
to 
a 
mistake 
of 
sound, 
 for 
rm, 
‘winnowed.’ 
It 
seems 
that 
raw

have 
been 
read 
by 
LXX., 
but 
this 
may 
have 
been 
in 
place 
of 
the 
omitted 
relative 
’R; 
anyhow 
they 
seem 
to 
have 
read 
‘winnowed,’ 
either 
rightly, 
or 
from 
the 
kindred 
word 
for 
‘fan’ 
below, 
and 
omitted 
something 
in 
their 
rendering; 
perhaps 
passing

λελικμημένα] 
This, 
the 
reading 
of 
ℵAQΓ 26 106 198 228 306 309 
seems 
easier 
than 
’s 
λελικμημένῃ. 
In

case 
the 
meaning 
of

somewhat 
strained.
ἰάσηται. .

The

corresponds 
with 
Heb., 
and 
at 
that 
distance

Lxx. 
probably 
inclined

‘reach’ 
in 
A.
V.

R.
V.,

literally 
‘divide,’

as 
pointed,

though 
the

of

divided 
by 
a 
nearly 
submerged

is 
easy 
and 
practically 
right.

‘shake’ 
or 
‘wave’ 
to

kindred

occurs 
in

better, 
there 
is 
probably 
some 
confusion.

The

the

to 
keep 
it 
strictly.

the

Here

some 
of 
the 
Luc. 
MSS. 
have 
δείξει, 
which 
is 
not 
unlikely 
to 
be 
right, 
as 
it 
gives 
easier 
connection 
and 
represents 
Heb. 
closely. 
Field 
prints 
it 
in 
his 1859 
(S.
P.
C.
K.) 
edition, 
in 
which 
he 
seems 
to 
have 
paid 
much 
regard 
to 
the 
Lucianic 
readings.

(A) 
must

treated

Heb. 
has 
simply 
‘with 
the

which 
Lxx. 
have 
endeavoured 
to 
bring 
into 
connection.
This 
and 
the 
following 
verse 
are 
obscure 
in 
the 
Heb., 
and 
it 
is 
not 
surprising 
to 
ﬁnd 
nut. 
in 
difficulties.

Almost 
a 
possible

‘passing ’ 
can 
be 
taken, 
like 33]),

no: 
read 
for

‘staff’; 
for 
the

cf.

The 
syntax 
is 
altered, 
ὅθεν 
being 
an 
insertion. 
βοηθείας 
is 
probably 
an 
attempt 
to 
render 
and 
explain 
ΑBBREV 
‘destiny’ 
(lit. 
‘foundation’); 
αὐτὸς 
possibly 
for 
and 
ἐπεποίθει 
for 
which 
is 
causal. 
The 
sense 
is 
altered 
in 
the 
Greek, 
which 
seems 
to 
suggest 
military 
music 
rather 
than 
thanksgiving.
ἐκ 
μεταβολῆς] 
This 
must 
be 
intended 
to 
represent 
‘waving,’ 
‘agitation,’ 
see 
on 
ver. 28, 
ταράξω.
ἀπατηθήσῃ] 
This, 
though 
found 
only 
in 
two 
cursives, 48 308 
is 
clearly 
the 
right 
reading, 
ἀπαιτηθήσῃ 
(NABQ 
ἃς.) 
being 
an 
easy 
corruption. 
Jerome 
renders 
the 
Lxx. 
here 
by 
decipieris. 
The 
main 
proof, 
however, 
is 
that 
it 
evidently 
renders 
the 
Heb. 
nnan, 
taking 
it 
as 
2nd 
pers. 
imperf. 
from 
=ἀπατάω 
(Job 
xxxi. 27): 
whereas 
it 
really 
‘a 
Τopheth’ 
or 
‘burningplace’ 
(see 
commentaries 
for 
explanation). 
This 
‘burningplace’ 
is 
made 
ready 
for 
the 
king 
of 
Asshur: 
“the 
Molochpile 
for 
the 
Μelech,” 
M. 
Arnold, 
Isaiah 
of 
p. 
The 
Heb. 
of 
the 
verse 
is 
obscure, 
and 
the 
Greek 
scarcely 
intelligible. 
πρὸ 
ἡμερῶν 
corresponds 
to 
lit. 
‘from ’ 
i.
e. 
beforehand. 
The 
MSS. 
vary 
in 
detail; 
the 
verse 
begins 
in 
A 
with 
οὐ 
γὰρ 
σύ, 
in 
B 
with 
σὺ 
γάρ, 
altered 
to 
σοὶ 
γάρ: 
in 
NQ 
with 
οὐ 
γάρ. 
The 
2nd 
pers. 
pronouns 
are 
no 
doubt 
due 
to 
the 
misunderstanding 
of 
Tophteh 
as 
the 
verb. 
μὴ 
καὶ 
σὺ 
is 
altered 
in 
B 
to 
μὴ 
καὶ 
σοί, 
giving 
an 
easier 
sense. 
The 
rest 
of 
the 
words 
show 
a 
general 
correspondence.
Topheth 
or 
Tophet 
was 
a 
name 
given 
to 
a 
place 
in 
the 
valley 
of 
Hinnom, 
where 
sacrifices 
were 
offered 
to 
Moloch (2 
Kings 
xxiii. 
IO, 
Jer. 
vii. 31, 
C.). 
There 
is 
possibly—
see 
the 
quotation 
above 
M. 
Arnold—
a 
play 
on 
words 
between 
Moloch 
and 
Melech, 
Of 
course 
no 
king 
of 
Assyria 
met 
his 
end 
at 
this 
Tophet, 
so 
far 
as 
is 
known. 
But, 
to 
those 
who 
do 
not 
seek 
to 
restrict 
the 
application 
of 
prophecy, 
it 
may 
not 
seem 
impossible 
that 
there 
may 
be 
a 
reference 
to 
the 
end 
of 
the 
last 
king 
of 
Nineveh, 
ﬁring 
his 
palace 
over 
himself: 
the 
story 
familiar 
from 
’s 
Sardcmapalus 
(=Assurbanipal), 
though 
later 
knowledge 
transfers 
the 
event 
to 
another 
king, 
whose 
name, 
however, 
is 
uncertain. 
See 
Nahum 
iii. 13, 
XXXI. 
Isaiah 
returns 
to 
his 
denunciation 
of 
Egypt 
as 
an 
ally.

Though

some

here 
the 
ordinary 
word 
for 
‘help.’ 
The 
verb 
is 
rendered 
by 
βοηθοῦντες 
in 
ver. 3,

βοήθεια

used 
as 
an 
interpretation 
of

rather 
weakly.

LXX.

‘meet,’ 
‘happen

Probably

omitting 
the

It 
is 
a 
question, 
how 
the 
Heb. 
prep. 
ABBREV 
is 
to 
be 
taken: 
whether 
the 
Lord 
of 
Hosts 
is 
represented 
as 
‘for’ 
(upon) 
or 
‘against’  
 mount 
Zion. 
Ewald 
and 
Cheyne, 
with 
A.
V., 
think 
the 
former; 
Hitzig, 
Delitzsch, 
Kay, 
Driver, 
W. 
E. 
Barnes, 
the 
latter, 
which 
LXX. 
seems 
to 
mean, 
though 
not 
certainly, 
cf. 
xxv. 6, 10, 
lviii. 14. 
The 
rapid 
transition 
from 
enmity 
to 
championship 
(same 
Heb. 
prepos. 
before 
‘Jerusalem’ 
in 
the 
next 
verse) 
is 
what 
some 
feel 
to 
be 
the 
difficulty, 
others 
to 
be 
specially 
characteristic 
of 
Isaiah. 
(The 
prepos. 
in 
Zech. 
xiv. 14 
is 
different.)

The

in 
Heb. 
is 
here 
closely 
connected, 
by 
many 
good 
authorities, 
with 
each 
of 
the 
two 
words 
for 
man; 
i.
e. 
‘by

of

human ’ 
The 
two 
words 
ish 
and 
adam 
(cf. 
ii. 9, 
c.) 
are 
considered 
to 
supplement 
one 
another 
(Ps. 
xlix. 2) 
rather 
than 
to 
give 
a 
special 
contrast.
οὔκ

The 
negative 
is 
supplied 
by 
LXX.

took 
to 
be 
the 
meaning.

Heb. 
‘shall

‘pass

looks 
as 
though 
the 
sense 
of 
surrounding

been 
attached 
to

on

possibly

The 
order 
of 
these 
expressions 
is, 
however, 
in 
this 
case, 
reversed 
from 
the 
Heb. 
which 
happens 
but 
seldom, 
especially 
in 
the 
text 
of

as 
given

Heb. 
has

perhaps 
guessed).

Some 
of

betrayed 
by 
one 
error 
into 
another.

far 
better

Heb. 
verb

here

‘a

Lxx. 
have 
taken 
‘hiding

as 
a

though 
an 
active 
partic. 
does 
not 
occur 
in 
this 
precise 
form.
τοὺς 
λόγους 
τούτους] 
For 
αὐτοῦ, 
Α 
alone 
reads 
τούτους. 
Heb. 
has 
‘(from 
the) ’ 
and 
there 
is 
no 
very 
likely 
misreading; 
mm: 
warm 
for 
nwnnnn 
is 
perhaps 
not 
beyond 
the 
range 
of 
discrepancy, 
but 
it 
seems 
more 
likely 
that 
τοὺς 
λόγους 
interprets 
‘breath’ 
somewhat 
as 
in 
xi. 
καὶ 
κρυβήσεται] 
Another 
departure 
from 
the 
syntax 
of 
Heb. 
The 
next 
few 
words 
in 
the 
Creek 
are 
difficult 
to 
account 
for 
with 
exactness; 
ὡς 
ἀφ’ 
ὕδατος 
φερομένου 
is 
perhaps 
for 
‘rainstorm,’ 
or 
else 
includes 
also 
am, 
‘waters,’ 
with 
or 
without 
‘channels’: 
καὶ

accordingly, 
may 
be 
a

bears 
no 
visible 
relation 
to 
‘the 
shadow 
of 
a ’ 
and 
either 
it 
seems 
that 
Lxx. 
followed 
the 
drift 
of 
parallelism, 
as 
they 
thought, 
or 
a 
duplicate 
rendering 
of 
one 
clause 
has 
caused 
confusion, 
and 
partly 
taken 
the 
place 
of 
the 
other. 
’ith 
ἔνδοξος

are 
brought 
back 
to 
Heb. 
‘heavy,’ 
‘huge’ 
‘honourable,’

often 
a 
secondary 
meaning 
of 
words 
from 
this 
root); 
διψώσῃ 
is 
nearly 
the 
sense 
of 
the 
Heb., 
and 
the

may 
have 
led 
to 
this 
shade 
of

cf. 
also 
the 
use 
of

v. 27, 
xl. 30,

be 
that

Heb.

‘clearnesses,’ 
almost 
‘brightnesses.’ 
Can 
the 
Greek 
be 
a 
corruption 
from 
εἰλικρινῆ?
Heb. 
here 
foretells 
the 
removal 
of 
evils 
spoken 
of, 
v. 20: 
the 
falsifying 
of 
language, 
and 
through 
language 
of 
ideas, 
till 
weak 
minds 
are 
confused 
even 
as 
to 
elementary 
notions 
of 
right 
and 
wrong.
ἄρχειν] 
Interpreting 
Heb. 
‘noble’ 
‘the ’ 
ἄρχοντος, 
Job 
xxi. 28) 
as 
a 
verb. 
Notice 
εἴπωσιν 
ﬁrst 
with 
indirect, 
then 
direct 
construction. 
Heb. 
has 
two 
different 
verbs, 
the 
second 
passive 
(impers. 
with 
of 
person 
referred 
to).
οἱ 
ὑπηρέται 
σου] 
Heb. 
‘mean’ 
or 
‘knave,’ 
a 
word 
found 
only 
here 
and 
(in 
slightly 
different 
form) 
in 
ver. 7. 
mm. 
may 
not 
have 
known 
the 
word, 
and 
taken 
it 
here 
‘means,’ 
‘instruments,’ 
applied 
to 
persons.
Σίγα] 
Scholz 
thinks 
an 
attempt 
has 
been 
made 
to 
represent 
the 
sound 
of 
Heb. 
‘liberal,’ 
‘affluent.’ 
If 
this 
be 
so, 
the 
sense 
been 
lost 
sight 
of. 
But 
perhaps 
Lxx. 
read 
the 
word 
from 
one 
of 
the 
many 
roots 
of 
somewhat 
similar 
and 
confusing 
form, 
e.
g. 
xxxviii. 13, 
Ps. 
cxxxi. 2: 
in 
the 
latter 
place 
it 
is 
rendered 
ἐταπεινοφρόνουν, 
and 
is 
parallel 
in 
Heb. 
to 
‘quieted’: 
in 
the 
former 
R.
V. 
render 
‘I 
quieted 
myself’; 
but 
the 
word 
is 
obscure.

ποιῆσαι] 
ποιήσει,

agrees 
with 
Heb.; 
but 
the 
Greek 
sentence 
is 
against 
it, 
and 
the 
weight 
of 
MS. 
evidence.

If

answer 
to 
‘And

his

above, 
on 
ver. 5. 
βουλεύεται, 
below, 
renders 
the 
usual 
Heb. 
word, 
so 
that 
βουλὴ 
appears 
to 
be 
a 
guess, 
or 
a 
supplement 
(see 
xxix. 1 5, 
xxxi. 6) 
to 
take 
the 
place 
of 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
verse, 
which 
was 
very 
likely 
not 
understood.
διασκεδάσαι] 
This 
parallel 
verb 
is 
introduced 
by 
Lxx., 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
verse 
corresponding 
in 
words, 
though 
the 
syntax 
and 
sense 
are 
changed.

Heb.

cognate 
words,

the 
root 
represented 
by 
ἄρχειν 
in 
ver. 5. 
εὐσεβεῖς 
is 
a 
fairly 
good 
rendering, 
inasmuch 
as 
the 
Heb. 
word 
is 
used 
of 
those 
who 
offered 
willingly 
for 
the 
tabernacle, 
Exod. 
xxv. 2,

This 
paraphrase–
for 
the 
Greek, 
cf. 
xxv. 5, 
xxviii. 
avoids 
the 
third 
recurrence 
of 
the 
Heb. 
word. 
Possibly, 
however, 
it 
is 
due 
to 
misreading, 
as 
Heb. 
has 
a 
pronoun, 
though 
not 
fem., 
and 
the 
prep.

have

Rightly

rendered 
(also 
rightly) 
by 
ἀνάστητε.
πλούσιαι] 
Heb. 
‘at 
ease,’ 
‘unconcerned,’ 
‘secure’: 
used 
in 
bad 
sense, 
according 
to 
Cheyne, 
except 
in 
ver. 18 
below, 
and 
xxxiii. 20. 
In 
Amos

parallel 
word 
as 
here. 
See 
also 
Ps. 
cxxiii. 4, 
and 
Zech. 
i. 15. 
The 
fault 
seems 
to 
be, 
that 
some 
are 
well 
off 
who 
are 
not 
entitled 
so 
to 
be,

suffer.

Lxx. 
sometimes 
use 
ἐλπὶς

here,

in 
the 
next 
verse; 
the 
word, 
as 
we 
have 
seen, 
is 
a 
favourite 
with 
them, 
and 
they 
seem 
to 
give

something 
of 
the

of 
‘conﬁdence’

in

that 
probably 
as 
though 
with 
diff. 
vowelpoints, 
as 
the 
maritime 
plain, 
as 
in 
Josh. 
x. 40, 
xi. 2. 
‘Low 
in ’ 
is 
by 
most 
authorities 
considered 
to 
mean 
‘utterly ’

margin. 
Possibly, 
however, 
the 
Lxx. 
interpretation 
is 
correct, 
except 
as 
to 
ἐν 
τοῖς 
δρυμοῖς 
πεποιθότες. 
The 
verse 
seems 
to 
describe 
peace 
and 
shelter 
in 
a 
humble 
but 
protected 
situation, 
while 
storms 
rage 
on 
forests 
and 
hill 
sides. 
The 
vales 
and 
riverbanks 
are 
quiet.
σπείροντες

Cf. 
Eccles. 
xi.

Lxx. 
appear 
to 
have 
taken 
‘ox’ 
and 
‘ass’ 
as 
the 
subject, 
and 
‘send 
forth 
the ’ 
as 
a 
phrase 
like 
νέμειν 
ποδά. 
Lowth 
quotes 
an 
account 
of 
riceplanting 
by 
treading 
over 
the 
ground 
with 
cattle 
before 
it 
is 
flooded. 
But 
the 
scene 
is 
more 
probably 
of 
simple 
rural  
 peace 
and 
prosperity. 
In 
warm 
climates, 
the 
river 
sides 
are 
the 
favourite 
haunts 
of 
all 
beasts, 
domestic 
as 
well 
as 
wild.
Scholz, 
thinking 
of 
the 
overflow 
of 
the 
Nile, 
takes 
the 
verse 
as 
evidence 
of 
the 
Egyptian 
knowledge 
of 
the 
translator. 
But 
the 
argument 
is 
doubleedged, 
and 
unnecessary. 
Palestine 
is 
a 
land 
of 
torrentstreams: 
“Jordan 
overfloweth 
all 
his 
banks 
all 
the 
time 
of 
harvest” 
(Josh. 
iii. 15; 
cf. 
I 
Chron. 
xii. 
XXXIII. 
This 
unprovoked 
aggressor 
is 
generally 
considered 
to 
be 
the 
Assyrian; 
for 
so, 
on 
the 
whole, 
he 
was, 
and 
Israel 
and 
Judah 
powerless 
before 
him.
I. 
LXX. 
have 
reduced 
this 
verse 
to 
something 
apparently 
widely 
different 
from 
Heb. 
Yet, 
if 
the 
ﬁrst 
ὑμᾶς 
were 
omitted, 
and 
a 
stop 
inserted 
after 
ἀθετῶν, 
supplying 
an 
indefinite 
subject 
to 
ἀθετεῖ, 
it 
would 
bring 
the 
ﬁrst 
part 
of 
the 
verse 
very 
near 
to 
the 
meaning 
of 
the 
original. 
There 
is 
no 
ground 
for 
supposing 
this 
to 
be 
the 
genuine 
Lxx. 
reading 
or 
intention; 
it 
merely 
shows 
how 
small 
the 
verbal 
departure 
is.
ὑμᾶς, 
ὑμᾶς] 
nnx 
‘thou’ 
read 
as 
name, 
iated 
perhaps, 
may 
account 
for 
one; 
the 
other 
must 
be 
an 
addition 
by 
Lxx.
ὅ 
ἀθετῶν] 
Cf. 
xxi. 2, 
xxiv. 16, 
xlviii. 
ἁλώσονται] 
The

is 
apparently 
taken 
as 
equivalent 
to 
‘be 
destroyed,’ 
‘come 
to 
an
οἱ 
ἀθετοῦντες] 
This 
seems 
now 
to 
represent 
the 
other 
parallel 
verb, 
‘spoileth,’ 
or 
‘destroyeth’ 
ἀνομέω 
in 
xxi. 
καὶ

Heb. 
has 
same 
verb 
again, 
‘thou 
shalt 
be ’: 
Lxx. 
fall 
back 
on 
a 
stopgap 
word, 
see 
on 
xxiii. 7, 
c.; 
and 
ἡττηθήσονται 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
verse 
seems 
to 
be 
intrOduced 
in 
much 
the 
same 
way 
to 
balance 
it.
ὥς 
σὴς 
ἐπὶ 
ἱματίου] 
ἐπὶ 
ἱματίου 
is 
evidently 
‘to

(in 
dealing) ’ 
read 
as 
the 
noun 
‘cloak,’ 
‘garment,’ 
with 
prep. 5

or 
read 
as

off 
the 
track, 
Lxx. 
guessed 
or 
misread 
also 
the 
previous 
word 111513, 
‘when 
thou 
hast ’ 
(or, 
‘ﬁnished’: 
the 
form 
is 
unusual, 
and 
some 
read 111533, 
giving 
this 
sense 
more 
decidedly). 
What 
they 
made 
of 
it 
is 
hard 
to 
say: 
 would 
mean 
‘like 
an ’ 
but 
the 
Bible 
does 
not 
mention 
ants 
in 
connection 
with 
destructiveness. 
Ver. 5 
probably 
helped 
to 
confirm 
them 
in 
their 
error.
An 
apparently 
abrupt 
transition, 
to 
a 
passage 
resembling 
especially 
xxvi. 8 
(so 
Kay).
τὸ 
σπέρμα] 
‘seed’ 
for 
‘arm’: 
cf. 
xlviii. 
τῶν 
ἀπειθοῦντων] 
Scholz 
thinks 
‘in 
the 
morning’ 
was  
 as 
D'
but 
looking 
to 
ver. 1, 
and 
other 
passages, 
we 
should 
expect 
ἀθετούντων 
in 
that 
case. 
If 
 were 
taken 
as 
participle, 
the 
meaning 
is 
nearly 
the 
opposite 
of 
the 
Greek: 
and 
LXX., 
especially 
in 
search 
of 
sense, 
often 
differ 
from 
Heb. 
to 
the 
extent 
of 
a 
negative: 
cf. 
ii. 11, 
and 
see 
list 
in 
Vol. 1. 
Introd. 
p. 52. 
Or 
it 
is 
conceivable 
that 
LXX. 
read 
some 
form 
from 
 ‘rebel.’.
εἰς 
ἀπώλωαν] 
Inserted 
by 
LXX.; 
cf. 
xiv. 20, 
xxxiv. 
διὰ 
φωνὴν 
τοῦ 
φόβου] 
Here 
φόβου 
sees 
to 
represent 
 ‘uproar,’ 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
‘tumult,’ 
and 
so 
panic: 
in 
xiii. 4, 
for 
same 
Heb. 
phrase, 
LXX. 
have 
merely 
φωνή: 
and 
in 1 
Kings 
xviii. 41 
LXX. 
have 
for 
it 
the 
fine 
phrase, 
howere

φωνὴν 
τῶν 
πδοῶν 
(τοῦ

ἀπὸ 
τοῦ 
φόβου

Heb. 
‘the 
lifting 
up 
of

φόβος 
here 
seems 
to 
mean 
‘fearfulness,’ 
i.
e.

unless 
for 
 LXX. 
read 
ἀπὸ

καὶ 
μεγάλου] 
A 
lone

inserts 
ἀπὸ, 
Luc.

having 
ἕως 
μεγάλου, 
according 
to 
the 
usual 
phrase 
(ἐπὶ 
or 
εἰς? 22). 
Heb. 
has 
‘the 
gathering 
of 
the 
caterpillar,’ 
or 
rather, 
some 
species 
of 
locust, 
as 
it 
would 
appear 
from 
Joel 4. 
Can 
LXX. 
have 
been 
thinking 
of 
different 
sizes 
of 
locusts, 
and 
the 
adjectives 
perhaps 
come 
from 
a 
marginal 
explanations? 
But 
Mr 
H. 
St 
J. 
Thackeray 
has 
pointed 
out 
that

uses. 
this 
phrase

not 
warranted

Theol. 
Studies, 
July 1903). 
See 
ix. 14, 
xxii. 5, 24, 
and 
ver. 19 
below.
συναγάγῃ]
Not 
the 
Heb. 
word 
used 
earlier 
in 
the 
verse, 
translated 
once, 
and 
lost 
the 
second 
time, 
see 
previous 
note. 
Here 
Heb. 
has 
from 
‘running’ 
to 
and 
fro: 
of 
which 
LXX. 
seem 
to 
have 
reversed 
the 
consonants, 
and 
taken 
it 
from 
which 
occurs 
in 
two 
forms, 
Zeph.

(συνάχθητε

συνδέθητε).

So 
ℵAQ

B 
has 
ἀκρίδα. 
The 
collective 
is 
quite 
possible 
in 
itself, 
see 
Exod.

however, 
final 
c 
might 
easily 
be 
lost 
before 
following

ἐμπαίζονται] 
The 
word 
 many 
here 
have 
been 
thus 
rendered, 
or 
again 
miseread. 
Scholz 
suggests 
 as 
their 
reading, 
by 
his 
favorite 
explanations 
of 
a 
sounderror. 
(παίζοντα, 
Gen. 
xxi. 9, 
is 
used 
for 
this 
word, 
and 
apparently 
duplicated 
as 
Isaac.) 
Such 
a 
discrepancy, 
however, 
if 
possiblein 
the 
first 
instance, 
would 
be 
most 
likely 
detected 
by 
a 
corrector 
of 
MSS. 
On 
the 
whole, 
if 
LXX. 
did 
not 
read 
 (and 
this 
is 
regularly 
rendered 
by 
συρίζω), 
t 
seems 
more 
probable 
that 
they 
tried 
to 
render 
the 
present 
Heb. 
text.
δικαιοσύνης] 
So 
ℵAQ; 
B 
has 
δικαιοσύνῃ. 
The 
former 
agrees  
 with 
Heb., 
and 
seems 
in 
itself 
preferable, 
the 
verse 
being 
then 
punctuated 
as 
in 
Heb.
ὲν 
νόμῳ 
παραδοθήσονται] 
ἐν 
νόμῳ 
may 
be 
an 
attempt 
to 
render 
nJiDR, 
‘faithfulness,’ 
a 
plural 
form: 
or 
can 
Lxx. 
have 
read 
more, 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
‘command,’ 
‘appointment’? 
In 
Nehem. 
xi. 23, 
is 
‘a 
settled 
provision,’ 
R.
V.; 
Lxx. 
omit 
the 
clause. 
The 
runs 
somewhat 
like 
the 
opening 
of 
xxxiv. 16, 
and 
παραδοθήσονται 
almost 
warns 
us 
that 
Lxx. 
are 
in 
difficulties. 
‘thy 
times,’ 
evidently 
been 
misread: 
the 
obscure 
word 
pinv 
suggests 
itself 
(xxiii. 18 
ﬁn.) 
but 
does 
not 
give 
any 
help.
ἐν 
Θησαυροῖς] 
Here 
stands 
for 
Ion, 
‘power,’ 
‘wealth.’ 
At 
the 
end 
of 
the 
verse, 
it 
corresponds 
more 
directly 
to 
‘treasure.’ 
The 
syntax 
is 
changed.
ἐκεῖ] 
Not 
in 
Heb.; 
apparently 
takes 
up 
the 
sense 
of 
ἐν

not 
in

except 
in 
so 
far 
as 
it 
appears 
to 
be 
a 
duplicate 
of 
what 
follows. 
Again, 
ἀξιοῦντες 
εἰρήνην, 
read 
after 
ἀποσταλήσονται

of

Removing 
these

This

must 
analyse,

οὓς 
ἐφοβεῖσθε] 
This 
seems 
to 
be 
‘your ’ 
for 
a 
doubtful 
phrase, 
generally 
rendered, 
with 
change 
of 
vowelpoints,

verb, 
(b) 
it 
agrees 
in 
meaning 
with 
Heb., 
(c) 
φοβηθ. 
may 
be 
due 
to 
confusion 
with 
the 
previous 
(duplicate) 
words. 
In 
the 
’orum 
Apocryplza, 
in 
a 
note 
on 
Judith 
xvi. 11 
Mr 
Ball 
points 
out 
a 
similar 
confusion 
between 
these 
verbs: 
to 
which 
we 
may 
add 
a 
very 
similar 
case 
in 
xxiv. 14 
above.
ἀποσταλήσονται] 
This 
word, 
and 
ἀξιοῦντες, 
are 
additions 
of 
the 
LXX., 
to 
complete 
the 
sense, 
as 
they 
have 
a 
participle 
for 
the 
verb  
 ‘shall 
weep,’ 
and 
preferred 
a 
more 
precise 
connecting 
link 
‘messengers’ 
and 
‘peace.’ 
Ἀποσταλήσονται 
might 
indeed 
have 
been 
suggested 
by 
the 
letters 
of 
‘peace’: 
but 
in 
that 
case 
there 
would 
be 
a 
triplicate 
rendering 
of 
this 
word.
τούτων 
and 
πρὸς

are 
not

It 
is 
not 
very 
clear 
how 
Lxx. 
have 
dealt 
with 
this 
verse. 
The 
easiest 
supposition 
seems 
to 
be, 
that, 
confusing 
the, 
two 
expressions, 
ms 
wayfaring 
man’ 
and 
Dam 
‘he 
the ’ 
they 
omitted 
the 
ﬁrst, 
and 
put 
the 
second 
in 
its 
place, 
reading 
‘peoples’ 
for 
and 
perhaps 
taking 080, 
in 
the 
sense, 
of 
DOD, 
of 
fainting 
for 
fear. 
Whether 
was 
conversely 
read 
after 
‘covenant,’ 
and 
won, 
‘he 
hath ’ 
omitted, 
or 
the 
latter 
paraphrased 
as 
αἴρεται, 
it 
is 
hardly 
possible 
to 
say. 
This 
verse 
and 
the 
following 
are 
certainly 
treated 
either 
with 
some 
freedom, 
or 
with 
some 
want 
of 
grip.
The 
Greek 
omits 
the 
second 
verb 
in 
the 
ﬁrst 
clause, 
possibly 
in 
the 
second 
also. 
ἕλη 
is 
difficult; 
by 
the 
order 
it 
would 
correspond 
to 
Sop, 
‘withereth,’ 
but 
no 
clue 
to 
any 
connection 
appears, 
unless 
LXX. 
read 
was, 
see 
on 
xxxv. 7: 
there 
is 
also 
‘like 
a 
desert.’ 
to 
for 
‘willows,’ 
might 
perhaps 
have 
suggested 
the 
Greek.
φανερὰ 
ἔσται] 
This 
phrase 
suggests 
that 
‘shakes 
off’ 
taken 
as 
a 
passive 
of 
mu, 
‘make 
bare’ 
(however, 
in 
xxxii. 15 
it 
in 
a 
different 
sense, 
‘be 
poured 
out’). 
Originally, 
therefore, 
translation 
would 
mean 
‘shall 
be 
laid ’; 
but 
probably 
it 
was 
thought 
later 
to 
mean 
‘glorious’ 
(see 
on 
Γαλιλάια, 
above).
Γαλιλαία] 
Lxx. 
substitute 
this 
name 
for 
the 
neighbouring 
‘Bashan,’ ’ 
perhaps 
to 
do 
it 
honour,

of 
ix.

It

hardly 
likely 
that

two. 
Cyprian 
may 
have 
quoted 
from 
a 
copy 
whose 
original 
had 
a 
correction 
in 
its  
 text. 
On 
the 
whole, 
’s 
reading 
seems 
best: 
‘hay,’ 
‘dry 
grass, 
may 
have 
been 
read 
as 
some 
part 
of ‘13 
‘be 
ashamed’ 
cf. 
the 
discrepancy 
in 
xxviii. 
ματαία 
ἔσται 
ἢ 
ἰσχὺς] 
Heb. 
apparently 
‘ye 
shall 
bring 
forth 
stubble.’ 
Lxx. 
do 
not 
seem 
to 
be 
paraphrasing 
this, 
but 
to 
be 
reduced 
to 
guesswork. 
ματαία 
might 
indeed 
be 
due 
to 
w 
‘stubble’: 
but 
it 
is, 
strictly 
speaking, 
out 
of 
the 
order, 
and 
no 
plausible 
suggestion 
of 
a 
misreading 
occurs.
τοῦ 
πνεύματος] 
This 
connection 
of 
πνεύματος· 
with 
what 
precedes 
is 
against 
Heb. 
accents, 
and 
against 
the 
generally 
approved 
rendering 
of 
Heb.
ἐν 
ἀγρῷ] 
Scholz 
gives 
this 
as 
mia 
‘ﬁeld’ 
for 
Ἰὼ 
‘lime.’ 
It 
is 
again, 
however, 
out 
of 
the 
strict 
order. 
If 
had 
been 
read 
as 
’s 
special 
word 
for 
‘thorns,’ 
we 
should 
have 
ἄκανθα 
accounted 
for 
in 
its 
place, 
and 
the 
converse 
of 
the 
misreading, 
as 
it 
appears, 
in 
xxvii. 3. 
The 
word 
in 
Heb. 
which 
means 
‘thorns’ 
here, 
curiously 
enough, 
has 
a 
close 
resemblance 
to 
one 
meaning 
‘ends’ 
from 
root 
cut 
off.’ 
LXX., 
with 
a 
general 
notion 
of 
a 
have 
elsewhere 
curiously 
different 
renderings 
of 
the 
separate 
words, 
coming 
eventually 
near 
to 
the 
original 
meaning; 
see 
especially 
on 
v. 
ἐρριμμένη] 
Heb. 
‘cut 
down,’ 
or 
‘cut 
up,’ 
from 
lxxx. 16 
ἀνεσκαμμένη). 
Perhaps 
read 
here 
as 
from 
‘scattered.’ 
κατακεκαυμένη 
serves 
to 
render 
the 
remaining 
phrase 
of 
the 
verse.
Ἀκούσονται . . . 
γνώσονται] 
Lxx. 
take 
Heb. 
imperatives 
as 
3rd 
pers. 
plur., 
which 
would 
require 
different 
pointing, 
and 
probably 
prefixed 
to 
the 
former 
verb.
ἀσεβεῖς] 
Heb. 
cf. 
ix. 17, 
x. 6, 
xxiv. 5, 
xxxii. 6. 
Lxx. 
generally 
render 
by 
ἄνομοι, 
but 
this 
word 
is 
here 
already 
taken 
up. 
(See 
Hatch, 
Essays 
in 
Bibl. 
Greek, 11. 
p. 91, 
for 
an 
interesting 
but 
scarcely 
conclusive 
remark 
on 
ὑποκριτής 
in 
the 
later 
versions.)
ἀναγγελεῖ] 
from 
‘make 
known,’ 
read 
for 
from 
 ‘sojourn.’ 
The 
resulting 
version 
is 
somewhat 
bald.
ὑμῖν. . . 
ὑμῖν] 
Heb. 
‘among 
us,’ 
both 
times. 
The 
dat. 
corresponds 
to 
the 
Heb., 
and 
ἡμεῖς 
and 
ὑμεῖς 
are 
constantly 
confused 
in 
Greek 
MSS. 
When 
they 
are 
agreed 
on 
this 
and 
similar 
points, 
they 
frequently 
differ 
from 
Heb. 
Vulg. 
also 
has 
vobis.
τόπον] 
Explained 
by 
Scholz 
as 
for 
‘burnings.’
μισῶν] 
Scholz 
thinks 
this 
word 
was 
chosen 
for 
its 
resemblance 
to 
Heb. 
DRD, 
‘rejecting.’ 
Vulg. 
well 
projicit.
ἀνομίαν 
καὶ 
ἀδικίαν] 
The 
Heb. 
words 
occur 
together, 
Ezek. 
xxii. 12. 
Unjust, 
fraudulent 
gain 
is 
referred 
to.
Minor 
differences 
of 
syntax 
are 
to 
be 
observed.
γῆν 
πόρρωθεν] 
Heb. 
‘a 
land 
of 
distances.’ 
Most 
modern 
authorities 
interpret 
this 
as 
meaning 
‘a 
farstretching 
land.’ 
‘A 
land 
of 
distance’ 
(sing.) 
certainly 
seems 
to 
mean 
regularly 
‘a 
distant 
land’ 
as 
in 
xiii. 5, 
xxxix. 3 
(a 
fem. 
form), 
xlvi. 11; 
Jerem. 
viii. 19 
is 
plur., 
as 
here, 
and 
Ezek. 
xii. 27, 
of 
time, 
has 
a 
fem. 
plur. 
form. 
In 
Zech. 
x. 9 
a 
slightly 
different 
form 
(in 
pointing) 
of 
the 
word 
‘distances’ 
is 
used 
as 
equivalent 
to 
‘far 
countries.’ 
LXX., 
like 
A.
V., 
seem 
to 
something 
like 
a 
Pisgahsight.
Albert 
Barnes, 
taking 
in 
his 
commentary 
nearly 
the 
modern 
view, 
quotes 
Virg. 
Aen. 11. 27: 
“Juvat 
ire 
et 
Dorica 
castra
Desertosque 
videre 
locos, 
litusque 
relictum,’
 which 
seems 
however, 
in 
any 
case, 
to 
be 
more 
applicable 
to 
the 
next 
verse.
ὑμῶν]

Κυρίου

by 
A 26, 
but 
is 
not 
in 
Heb., 
nor 
in 
MSS. 
generally

it 
appears 
to 
be 
a 
’s 
addition.

Ii. 
St

τοὺς 
συστρεφομένους] ℵ 
ΑΟΓ 26 41 49 51 91 104 106 198 228 239 306 309 
read 
thus: 
Luc. 
MSS. 
have 
ἀναστρεφομένους, 
Β 
τρεφομένους, 
which 
alone 
appears 
to 
give 
any 
sense 
in 
connection 
with 
the 
Heb., 
the 
word 
‘towers’ 
being 
literally 
‘a 
thing 
raised 
up,’ 
and 
the 
verb 
applied 
to 
‘rearing 
up’: 
so 
in 
i. 2 
Lxx. 
have 
ἐγέννησα, 
Aq. 
Theod. 
ἐξέθρεψα 
for 
it. 
Consequently 
it 
seems 
that 
συντρεφομένους 
is 
the 
original 
of 
A'
s 
reading, 
though 
even 
then 
the 
preposition 
is 
hard 
to 
account 
for. 
This, 
on 
a 
wrong 
idea 
of 
the 
intended 
meaning, 
was 
corrupted 
to 
συστρεφ., 
and 
later 
improved 
into 
ἀναστρεφ. 
But 
possibly 
cyc 
was 
wrongly 
written 
after 
τογc. 86 
has 
συντρεφ., 144 
ανατρεφομενους.
On 
this 
verse, 
in 
the 
Hebrew, 
the 
commentators 
quote 
Virg. 
Am. 1. 203, 
“Haec 
olim

Theb., 
the 
Chieftains 
cast 
lots 
for 
their 
points 
of 
attack: 126, 375, 426, 
c.
This 
verse 
seems 
to 
have 
been 
amplified, 
with 
some 
from 
the 
meaning. 
μικρὸν 
καίω...
ᾦ 
οὗ 
(συνεβουλεύσαν)...
τῷ 
seem 
to 
be 
additions, 
and 
also 
the 
copula 
in 
οὐδέ: 
while 
λαὸς 
is 
repeated 
in 
a 
different 
place.
μικρὸν 
καὶ 
μέγαν] 
See 
on 
ver. 4. 
μέγαν 
might 
be 
due 
to 
taking 
from 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
‘strength’: 
but 
more 
likely 
from 
duplicating 
from 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
phrase 
being 
prefixed 
without 
warrant. 
In 
this 
latter 
case 
συνεβουλεύσαν 
is 
read 
as 
 the 
negative 
introduced 
to 
couple 
it 
with 
ᾔδει = 
the 
misread. 
After 
ᾔδει 
there 
should 
probably 
be 
a 
colon, 
and 
the 
sentence 
is 
twice 
taken 
up, 
with 
βαθύφωνον = 
‘deep 
of 
language,’ 
in 
accus., 
and 
with 
λαὸς 
πεφαυλισμένος 
in 
the 
nominative, 
cams 
pendens.
συνεβουλευσαν 
is 
the 
reading 
of 
A 41 86 106 198: 
ℵQΓ 
συνεβουλεύσαντο, 
Β 
συνεβουλεύσατο.
πεφαυλισμένος] 
Heb. 
‘stammering’ 
is 
actually 
the 
passive 
of 
a 
verb 
meaning 
‘deride.’ 
see 
on 
xxviii. 
πόλις 
πλουσία] 
See 
xxxii. 18, 
and 
for 
the 
adjective, 
also 9 13, 14 
are 
different.
σκηναὶ . . .

Simile 
of

its 
pegs 
and 
ropes. 
Cf. 
liv. 2, 
and 
see 
below, 
on

ὄνομα] 
Taking 
‘there’ 
as 
‘name.’ 
The 
sense 
consequently 
differs.
τόπος] 
Some 
have 
explained 
the 
Heb. 
‘place’ 
as = 
‘in 
place 
of. 
Delitzsch 
refers 
to 
I 
Kings 
xxi. 19 
as 
proving, 
“if 
Hosea 
i. 10 
does 
not,” 
that 
it 
may 
have 
that 
meaning; 
but 
disapproves 
it
Κυρίου . . . 
ἐστίν . . . 
ὑμῖν 
ἔσται] 
For 
A'
s 
ἐστίν, 
the 
MSS. 
generally 
have 
ὑμῖν. 
Probably 
duplicate 
renderings 
of 
mm 
Κυρίου 
being 
out 
of 
its 
order 
the 
ﬁrst 
time, 
and 
the 
word 
read 
as 
the 
second 
time, 
with 
change 
of 
pronoun.
πλατεῖς 
καὶ 
εὐρύχωροι] 
Heb. 
‘wide 
stretching,’ 
‘broad 
of 
lit. 
‘of 
hands,
The 
latter 
part 
of 
the 
verse 
is 
somewhat 
different 
in 
Gr. 
and 
Heb. 
At 
ﬁrst 
sight, 
‘gallant ’ 
appears 
to 
be 
omitted. 
But 
‘gallant’ 
is 
the 
same 
Heb. 
word 
as 
‘in 
majesty’ 
earlier 
in 
the 
verse, 
and 
μέγας 
stands 
for 
it 
in 
both 
places. 
‘ship,’ 
appears 
to 
have 
been 
read 
as 
(γάρ) 
and 
ὁ 
θεὸς 
inserted. 
By 
the 
order 
of 
words, 
it 
is 
probable 
that 
οὐδὲ  
 πορεύσεται 
is 
added 
by 
LXX., 
and 
that 
οὗ 
παρελεύσεταί 
με 
represents 
the 
‘shall 
pass’ 
of
ἄρχον] 
Somewhat 
vague 
for 
‘lawgiver,’ 
which 
Scholz 
however 
seems 
to 
be 
wrong 
in 
classing 
as 
omitted 
by 
LXX., 
or 
rather, 
among 
his 
“Zusätze 
zum 
hebr. 
Texte.” 
After 
all, 
the 
Athens 
were 
ἄρχοντες.
Generally 
taken 
as 
a 
simile 
of 
a 
ship, 
as 
in 
Horace, 
Od. 1. 
xiv., 
“O 
navis, 
referent 
in 
mare 
te 
novi
Fluctus, 
c.’
 But 
Kay, 
following 
Clericus, 
argues 
with 
much 
probability 
that 
it 
is 
a 
return 
to 
the 
image 
of 
the 
tent, 
with 
its 
‘cords,’ 
same 
Heb. 
word 
as 
in 
ver. 20, 
its 
‘pole,’ 
and 
‘banner.’ 
This 
last 
word 
is 
not, 
indeed, 
properly 
used 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
‘sail.’
σχοινία 
suits 
either 
interpretation, 
as 
does 
ἱστός, 
‘mast’ 
or 
‘tentpole’; 
while 
οὐ 
χαλάσει 
τὰ 
ἱστία 
and 
οὐκ 
ἀρεῖ 
σημεῖον 
are 
duplicates, 
one 
suiting 
the 
ship, 
the 
other 
the 
tent: 
raising 
and 
unfurling 
a. 
standard 
being 
closely 
connected. 
As 
it 
stands, 
Lxx. 
must 
necessarily 
be 
taken 
of 
the 
ship: 
but 
traces 
of 
another 
rendering, 
possibly 
of 
the 
other 
interpretation, 
survive.
οὖ . . . 
τοίνυν] 
‘prey,’ 
was 
probably 
taken 
as 
conj. 
‘until,’ 
and 
accidentally 
or 
otherwise 
put 
at 
the 
head 
of 
the 
clause 
in 
place 
of 
m, 
‘then,’ 
which 
was 
transposed 
to 
the 
next 
clause 
as 
τοίνυν.
πολλοὶ] 
Epithet 
transferred 
from 
‘plunder’ 
to 
‘lame’: 
in 
Heb. 
it 
is 
a 
noun, 
‘abundance.
‘The 
inhabitant’ 
is 
omitted 
by 
lxx., 
and 
the 
sentence 
adjusted 
to 
a 
single 
subject.
ἀφέθη] 
Probably 
an 
aorist 
with 
augment 
omitted: 
cf.

(See 
Swete, 
lutrod.

The

ﬁrst 
two

prints

This 
subjunctive

been 
suspected 
in 
the 
Heb.) 
The 
late

to 
be 
due 
to

it 
is 
doubtful 
how 
much 
of 
the

the

The

is 
not 
exact. 
The 
meaning 
of 
the 
original 
was 
probably 
hazy 
to 
the 
translators.
ὀνοκένταυροι] 
Here 
Heb. 
has 
Lilith. 
This 
was 
the 
name 
of 
a 
female 
demon 
of 
Chaldaic 
mythology, 
who 
deceived 
Adam, 
according 
to 
Rabbinic 
legends, 
and 
who 
murdered 
children. 
Perhaps 
here 
‘the 
screechowl,’ 
as 
Kay 
and 
W. 
E. 
Barnes. 
Cheyne 
renders, 
‘the 
nighthag.’ 
The 
objections 
to 
supposing 
that 
Isaiah

together 
wild 
beasts

demons 
are, 
however, 
serious.

The

an 
attempt 
to 
preserve 
some 
consistency 
in 
the

with 
ver. 16.

LXX. 
may 
have 
guessed; 
(Deut.

not 
so 
unlike 
see 
note 
on 
xvii. 9: 
or 
some 
confusion 
may 
have 
arisen 
between

so 
with

is 
the

regularly 
rendered

This 
again 
may 
be 
a

be 
read 
wrongly 
as 
the 
remaining

some 
other

ἀριθμῷ] 
Evidently 
WED, 
‘the

taken 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
‘number,’ 
which 
it 
does 
not, 
perhaps, 
bear 
with 
its 
present 
pointing, 
though 
the 
verb 
has 
that 
meaning, 
as 
well 
as 
kindred 
nouns. 
Some 
critics 
have 
sought 
to 
reconstruct 
the 
Heb. 
in 
the 
light 
of 
Lxx. 
(see 
Cheyne'
s 
commentary 
ad 
loc.).
Κύριος] 
Heb. 
has 
here 
‘my 
mouth’: 
but 
‘the 
Lord’ 
occurs 
in 
the 
verse, 
and 
may 
have 
been 
transferred.
βόσκεσθαι] 
Heb. 
‘by

perhaps 
Lxx. 
read 
previous 
‘to

as 
‘bread,’ 
and 
as 
or 
the 
latter, 
taking 
as 
a 
verb.
This 
chapter 
and 
the 
following 
appear 
to 
be 
contrasted 
pictures 
of 
a 
judgment 
ending 
in 
desolation, 
and 
a 
joyful 
uprising 
and 
return 
of 
the 
ransomed. 
Edom, 
in 
ver. 5.

be 
a 
type 
of 
God'

Α 
comparison 
of 
Job 
iv. 3, 4, 
where

leaves 
little 
doubt 
that 
here 
it 
stands 
for

‘conﬁrm’; 
and 
probably 
was 
originally 
meant 
to 
govern

‘Say

has 
however 
dropped 
out 
from 
the

the

it 
is 
difficult 
to

absolute

that 
is 
quite 
satisfactory.

and 
the 
Heb. 
word 
is 
a 
very 
common 
one. 
Prof. 
Margoliouth, 
supposing 
the 
Greek 
“Wisdom 
of 
Solomon” 
to 
have 
preceded 
Greek 
Isaiah, 
says 
(Line: 
of 
Defence 
of 
the 
Bibl. 
Revelation, 
p. 17) 
“It 
would 
seem 
that 
the 
jingle 
of 
the 
Hebrew 
word 
in 
Isaiah 
with 
the 
Greek 
word 
used 
in 
Wisdom 
was 
what 
suggested 
this 
inaccurate 
but 
elegant 
rendering.” 
There 
certainly 
seems 
to 
be 
some 
affinity 
the 
Greek 
of 
Wisdom 
and 
Isaiah: 
see 
on 
iii. 10, 
and 
xliv. 20: 
but 
the 
difficulties 
seem 
rather 
increased 
than 
diminishedtby 
supposing 
Wisdom 
to 
be 
the 
earlier. 
On 
the 
whole, 
Scholz'
s 
view, 
which 
in 
itself 
Prof. 
Margoliouth 
supports, 
seems 
to 
go 
as 
far 
as 
is 
necessary 
in 
accounting 
for 
this 
peculiar 
word 
here.
ἦ 
ἄνυδρος] 
Heb. 
Sharab, 
here 
and 
xlix. 10. 
Many 
interpret 
it, 
according 
to 
the 
Arabic 
usage 
of 
the 
word, 
as 
‘mirage’: 
but 
it 
seems 
more 
proper 
to 
take 
it 
of 
the 
‘burning ’ 
which 
causes 
the 
mirage, 
which, 
even 
if 
it 
could 
be 
said 
to 
‘become 
a 
pool,’ 
could 
as 
in 
xlix. 10. 
‘smite’ 
them. 
The 
immediate 
effect 
of 
the 
mirage, 
moreover, 
appears 
to 
be 
refreshing 
rather 
than 
oppressive, 
until 
the 
delusion 
is 
perceived. 
The 
Heb. 
word 
means 
properly 
“glowing, 
dazzling 
dryness”.
εὐφροσύνη] 
Heb. 
here 
‘habitation,’ 
not 
as 
xxxii. 14. 
Perhaps 
a 
confusion 
of 
m: 
with 
nu, 
‘rest,’ 
to 
which, 
at 
least 
in 
the 
special 
form 
used 
Gen. 
viii. 21, 
a 
sense 
of 
satisfaction 
seems 
to 
be 
attached 
(if 
it 
is 
really 
from 
that 
root). 
But 
the 
Greek 
here 
may 
be 
a 
paraphrase—
or

found 
inserted

substituted 
elsewhere

‘reeds’

‘a

here 
it 
is

appears 
to 
mean 
‘reed’ 
only: 
but 
confusion 
would 
be 
easy 
under 
the 
circumstances.

Not

of 
this

of

Λύπη 
seems 
to 
be 
the

XXXVI. 
Chapters 
xxxvi.—
xxxix. 
give 
an 
account 
of 
certain 
events 
in 
’s 
reign, 
in 
which 
Isaiah 
took 
a 
principal 
part. 
Historical 
passages 
somewhat 
similar 
in 
tone, 
and 
in 
their 
hearing 
on 
the 
prophecies, 
occur 
in 
chap. 
vi.—
viii., 
xx. 
See 
also 
Amos 
vii. 
Jerem. 
xx., 
xxviii., 
xxxii., 
xxxv. 
foll., 
and 
Haggai. 
The 
ﬁrst 
of 
these  
 is 
the 
most 
like 
the 
present 
passage, 
the 
other 
prophets’ 
books 
being 
throughout 
more 
broken.
These 
chapters 
stand 
between 
the 
two 
main 
portions 
of 
the 
book, 
setting 
the 
seal 
of 
history, 
so 
to 
speak, 
upon 
Isaiah'
s 
Assyrian 
prophecies. 
It 
is 
hardly 
needful 
to 
repeat 
that 
many 
modern 
critics 
deny 
Isaiah'
s 
authorship 
of 
chh. 
xl.—
lxvi. 
On 
the 
whole 
it 
will 
found 
(whether 
there 
be 
any 
necessary 
connection 
between 
views 
held 
on 
these 
two 
questions, 
or 
no) 
that 
these 
deny 
also 
his 
authorship 
of 
xxxvi.—
xxxix., 
and 
hold 
that 
the 
parallel 
passages 
in 2 
Kings, 
17—xx. 19, 
are 
there 
found 
in 
their 
original 
place 
and 
form; 
while 
supporters 
of 
the 
traditional 
view, 
that 
Isaiah 
is 
the 
author, 
substantially, 
of 
all 
the 
sixtysix 
chapters 
of 
the 
book 
bearing 
his 
name, 
make 
no 
exception 
here, 
and 
consider 
that 
the 
compiler 
of 
Kings 
borrowed 
from 
Isaiah. 
Thus 
Kay 
says, 
“These 
two 
chapters 
(viz., 
xxxvi., 
xxxvii.)... 
are 
the 
historical 
goal 
of 
chh. 
vii.—
xxxv. 
The 
two 
following 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
are 
the 
historical 
startingpoint 
of 
chh. 
xl.—
lxvi.’ 
And 
previously: 
“These 
chapters 
are 
referred 
to 
in 2 
Chro. 
xxxii. 32 
as 
a 
part 
of 
the 
VISION 
of 
Isaiah. 
Nearly 
the 
whole 
of 
them 
is 
embodied 
in 2 
K. 
xviii—
xx,’
Delitzsch, 
allowing 
that 
the 
text 
in 
Kings 
“is 
in 
many 
places 
the 
better 
and 
more 
authentic,” 
warns 
us 
not 
to 
draw 
a 
hasty 
from 
this, 
as 
“in 
the 
relation 
of 
Jer. 
Iii. 
to 2 
Kings 
xxiv. 
18—xxv. 
have 
a 
proof 
that 
the 
text 
of 
a 
piece 
may 
be 
preserved 
more 
faithfully 
in 
the 
secondary 
place 
than 
in 
the 
original.” 
He 
gives 
several 
for 
thinking 
the 
passage 
original 
in 
Isaiah: 
i) 
That 
the 
author 
of 
Kings 
had 
Isaiah'
s 
book 
before 
him, 
as
 shown 
by 
comparing 2 
Kings 
xvi. 5 
with 
Isai. 
vii. 
(ii) 
The 
reference 
in 2 
Chron., 
as 
above.
(iii) 
That 
the 
Chronicler 
knows 
Isaiah 
as 
a 
historian 
of 
Uzziah'
s
 reign (2 
Chron. 
xxvi. 
(iv) 
That 
the 
style 
is 
prophetic 
in 
character, 
and 
worthy 
of
 Isaiah.
(v) 
That 
Isaiah 
elsewhere 
incorporates 
historical 
memoranda,
 speaking 
sometimes 
in 
the 
ﬁrst, 
sometimes 
in 
the 
third
 person.
(vi) 
Chap. 
vii. 3 
and 
xxxvi. 2 
betray 
the 
same 
author.
(vii) 
The 
order 
of 
the 
narrative, 
which 
is 
not 
chronological,
 is 
copied 
in 
Kings.
Vitringa 
thought 
Isaiah 
the 
author.
Prof. 
Skinner 
(Isaiah, 
in 
Camb. 
Bible 
for 
Schools) 
says, 
“there 
is 
no 
reasonable 
doubt 
that 
these 
chapters 
are 
an 
excerpt 
from 
the  
 canonical 
books 
of 
Kings...
the 
narrative 
before 
us 
reveals 
its 
secondary 
character 
by 
a 
tendency 
towards 
abridgement 
and 
simplification 
and 
in 
other 
respects 
shews 
‘manifest 
traces 
of 
having 
passed 
through 
the 
hands 
of 
the 
compiler 
of 
Kings.”’ 
These 
words 
he 
quotes 
Prof. 
Driver, 
who 
points 
out 
that “2 
Kings 
xviii. 14—16 
are 
not 
Isaiah, 
and 
are 
derived 
from 
a 
different 
source 
from 
that 
which 
has 
been 
followed 
by 
the 
compiler 
in 
the 
ensuing 
prophetical 
narrative.’ 
He 
holds 
that 
I 
sai. 
xxxvi.—
xxxix. 
“are 
probably 
in 
their 
more 
place 
in 
the 
Book 
of 
Kings, 
whence 
they 
were 
excerpted 
(with 
a 
few 
slight 
abridgments 
and 
alterations, 
and 
with 
one 
addition, 
viz. 
the 
Song 
of 
Hezekiah)”...“
The 
superior 
originality 
of 2 
Kings 
xx. 4 
to 
Isa. 
xxxviii. 4, 7—8 
is 
specially
Bp 
Lowth 
says, 
“We 
ﬁnd 
the 
same 
narrative 
in 
the 
Second 
Book 
of 
Kings,...
and 
these 
chapters 
of 
Isaiah,...
for 
much 
the 
most 
part 
(the 
account 
of 
the 
sickness 
of 
Hezekiah 
only 
excepted), 
are 
but 
a 
different 
copy 
of 
that 
narration.” 
At 
the 
beginning 
of 
ch. 
xxxix. 
says, 
“Hitherto 
the 
copy 
of 
this 
history 
in 
the 
Second 
Book 
of 
Kings 
has 
been 
the 
most 
correct: 
in 
this 
chapter, 
that 
in 
Isaiah 
has 
the 
advantage.’
Prof. 
W. 
E. 
Barnes 
says 
of 
xxxvi., 
xxxvii., 
“These 
chapters 
correspond 
(save 
for 
a 
few 
omissions) 
with 2 
Kings 
xviii. 
13—xix. 
both 
passages 
are 
probably 
drawn 
from 
the 
same 
source, 
viz. 
a 
book 
of 
the 
Annals 
of 
Judah.” 
(And 
similarly 
of 
xxxviii. 1—8, 21, 
On 
the 
whole, 
no 
hypothesis 
is 
free 
from 
difficulties. 
Probably 
it 
is 
a 
mistake 
to 
try 
to 
decide 
the 
question 
in 
the 
light 
of 
general 
theories 
as 
to 
the 
composition 
of 
the 
Book 
of 
Isaiah. 
The 
view 
that 
the 
original 
source 
of 
these 
chapters 
is 
to 
be 
sought 
in 
Isaiah 
seems 
rather 
the 
simpler.
On 
turning 
to 
the 
Septuagint, 
the 
verbal 
differences 
between 
Kings 
and 
Isaiah 
will 
be 
found 
considerable; 
exceeding 
the 
differences 
in 
the 
Hebrew, 
as 
though 
independently 
translated; 
following, 
however, 
as 
a 
rule, 
differences 
of 
the 
Heb. 
text; 
and 
the 
version 
in 
Kings 
generally 
closer 
than 
that 
in 
Isaiah. 
Hence, 
in 
some 
cases, 
when 
the 
Heb. 
is 
identical 
in 
Kings 
and 
Isaiah, 
it 
may 
happen 
that 
the 
mm. 
of 
Kings 
is 
closer 
than 
the 
Lxx. 
of 
Isaiah 
to 
the 
Hebrew 
of 
Isaiah. 
See, 
for 
instance, 
Kings 
xviii. 34 = 
Isai. 
xxxvi. 
Kings 
xx. 7 = 
Isai. 
xxxviii. 
(Delitzsch 
carefully 
notes 
the 
differences 
between 
the 
Heb. 
texts 
of 
Kings 
and 
Isaiah 
throughout.)
The 
Hexaplaric 
additions 
to 
the 
Greek 
text 
in 
Isaiah, 
several 
of  
 which 
are 
found 
in 
B, 
are 
nearly 
always 
identical 
with 
the 
Greek 
wording 
in 
Kings, 
or 
very 
close 
to 
it. 
On 
the 
other 
hand 
in 
Kings 
a 
few 
resemblances 
to 
the 
wording 
in 
Isaiah 
are 
found 
in 
Α, 
the 
influence 
of 
Aquila 
being 
perceptible. 
Thus 
the 
Lxx. 
of 
Kings 
in 
A, 
and 
of 
Isaiah 
in 
B, 
come 
nearest 
to 
one 
another 
among 
the 
principal 
uncials: 
being 
in 
each 
case, 
it 
would 
seem, 
less 
pure 
than 
their 
rivals. 
Conversely, 
’s 
Kings 
and 
’s 
Isaiah 
show 
wider 
divergence.
The 
chronology 
of 
these 
chapters 
is 
of 
wellknown 
difficulty, 
but 
cannot 
be 
discussed 
here. 
N 
o 
explanation 
has 
so 
far 
disposed 
of 
all 
awkwardness.
The 
Greek, 
in 
the 
narrative 
portions, 
presents 
comparatively 
little 
difficulty.
Σανναχηρεὶμ] 
Heb. 
Sanherib, 
Assyrian 
Sinakhiirib. 
Herodotus 
calls 
him 
Σανάριβος, 
which, 
except 
in 
the 
third 
vowel, 
is 
more 
accurate.
The 
narrative 
in 
Kings 
has 
an 
insertion 
before 
this, 2 
Kings 
xviii. 14—16. 
Here, 
it 
adds 
‘the 
Tartan 
and 
the 
Rabsaris’ 
Rabshakeh.’ 
Del. 
points 
out 
that 
xxxvii. 6 
implies 
more 
envoys 
one. 
The 
names 
are 
official 
titles. 
For 
Tartan, 
see 
on 
xx. 1. 
Rab= 
saris= 
‘chief 
eunuch,’ 
Rabshakeh = 
‘chief 
ﬂicer,’ 
or 
as 
modern 
has 
it 
‘Chief 
of 
the 
Staff.’ 
It 
resembles 
the 
Hebrew 
for 
‘chief 
butler, 
and 
may 
have 
been 
so 
understood 
by 
the 
Jews.

The

still 
uncertain.
For 
Eliakim

Shebna 
cf.

The 
latter—
the 
identity 
can 
hardly 
be

here 
in 
a 
subordinate 
but 
not 
as 
entirely

But 
we

how 
great 
this 
fall

nor 
whether

Τί 
πεποιθὼς 
εἰ] 
Lxx. 
of 
Kings 
agrees 
with 
Heb. 
of 
both 
places, 
rendering 
Τίς 
ἦ 
πεποίθησις 
αὕτη 
ἣν 
πέποιθας.
LXX. 
of 
Kings 
again 
agrees 
nearly 
with 
Heb., 
which 
has 
in 
Kings 
‘thou 
sayest,’ 
in 
Isaiah ‘1 
say’ 
(difference 
only 
of 
t 
in 
consonantal 
text). 
Literally 
Heb. 
here 
reads: ‘1 
say—
only 
a 
word 
of 
—counsel 
and 
strength 
for 
war.’ 
If 
Lxx. 
took 
the 
verb 
interrogatively, 
the 
Greek 
might 
almost 
be 
considered 
to 
be 
accounted 
for, 
and 
it 
has 
been 
proposed 
(by 
Wellhausen 
and 
Seinecke) 
to 
render 
in 
Kings, 
‘Thinkest 
thou 
that 
a 
mere 
word 
of 
the 
lips 
is 
counsel 
and 
strength 
for 
war?’ 
which 
comes, 
after 
all, 
somewhat 
near 
to 
nor. 
here.

 Ezekiel 
appears 
to 
imitate 
this 
passage, 
xxix. 6, 7; 
his 
elaboration 
of

forbids 
the 
converse 
view.

Again,

after

words: 
the

is 
almost 
in 
agreement 
with 
Lxx.

There 
are, 
however, 
many 
minor 
variants 
among 
the 
MSS. 
containing 
the 
words. 
The 
ﬁnal 
omission 
of

corresponds 
with 
the 
Heb., 
as

so 
that 
the 
Hexaplaric 
Isaiah 
again 
differs 
a 
little 
from 
it. 
At 
this 
point 
begins 
a 
fresh

ordinary.

It 
seems 
therefore 
hardly 
possible 
to 
decide 
certainly 
as 
to 
the 
meaning 
of 
each 
separate 
preposition; 
there 
seems 
to 
be 
a 
touch 
of 
opposition 
to 
the 
last, 
‘against’ 
the 
men 
that 
sit 
on 
the 
wall, 
while 
‘thy 
master 
and 
thou’ 
are 
treated 
contemptuously, 
as 
of 
least 
importance. 
With 
the 
men 
on 
the 
wall 
there 
may 
be 
dealings: 
on 
the 
king 
and 
his 
counsellor 
the 
haughty 
envoy 
will 
scarcely 
cast 
a 
glance.
Ἰουδαιστὶ] 
The 
Rabshakeh 
spoke 
at 
ﬁrst 
in 
Hebrew: 
when 
remonstrated 
with, 
he 
answered 
with 
a 
momentary 
compliance 
in 
Aramaic, 
in 
which 
he 
had 
been 
addressed; 
and 
then 
raised 
his 
voice 
again, 
and 
spoke 
in 
Hebrew, 
fully 
aware 
of 
the 
advantage 
it 
gave 
him.
τοῦ 
βασιλέως 
τοῦ 
μεγάλου] 
Here, 
and 
above, 
ver. 4, 
this 
phrase 
is 
an 
extra 
title, 
and 
βασιλεὺς· 
Ἀσσυρίων 
the 
ordinary 
designation. 
(Cf. 
βασιλεὺς 
of 
the 
king 
of 
Persia 
in 
Greek 
writers, 
e.
g. 
Thucyd.1. 128 137, 
c.) 
This 
is 
in 
agreement 
with 
Heb., 
and 
the 
words 
are 
therefore 
best 
so 
divided 
in 
Greek. 
In 
this 
phrase 
LXX. 
of 
Kings 
is 
shortened, 
and 
less 
exact: 
otherwise, 
the 
LXX. 
in 
each

its 
own

with 
fair 
exactness

The 
Heb. 
of 
Kings 
is 
fuller 
than 
that 
of 
Isaiah 
in 
this 
verse; 
adding 
after 
‘vineyards,’ 
‘a 
land 
of 
oil, 
olive 
and 
honey, 
that 
ye 
may 
live, 
and 
not 
die’: 
continuing 
‘and 
hearken 
not 
unto 
Hezekiah, 
when 
he 
enticeth,’ 
in 
place 
of 
‘Lest 
Hezekiah 
entice 
you.
LXX. 
of 
Kings 
and 
Isaiah 
follow 
each 
their 
own 
Heb. 
in 
the 
main: 
each 
has 
γῆ 
in 
nomin. 
by 
a 
species 
of 
attraction, 
perhaps, 
rather 
than 
casus 
pendent. 
Lxx. 
of 
Kings 
may 
be 
right 
in 
rendering 
by 
ὅτι 
rather 
than 
as 
‘when....’
Cf. 
chap. 
x. 8—11, 
as 
well 
as 
xxxvii. 12, 
Sepharvaim, 
not 
named 
in 
chap. 
x., 
was 
probably 
in 
S. 
Mesopotamia, 
on 
the 
Euphrates, 
a 
little 
above 
Babylon. 
Heb. 
of 
Kings 
adds 
here 
‘Hena 
and 
Ivah’ 
as 
in 
xxxvii. 13: 
in 
Lxx. 
of 
Kings 
B 
A 
inserts.
The 
Greek 
differs 
considerably 
in 
Kings 
and 
Isai.
μὴ 
ἐδύναντο 
ῥύσασθαι] 
Heb. 
literally 
‘and 
that 
they 
have 
delivered,’ 
i.
e. 
‘the 
idea 
of 
their 
delivering...’ 
Cf. 
such 
constructions 
as 
incepto 
desistere 
victam!” 
The 
same, 
without 
the 
‘and,’ 
in 
ver. 
and 
in 
both 
verses 
in 
Kings. 
Lxx. 
of 
Kings, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
has 
in 
the 
ﬁrst 
sentence 
καὶ 
ὅτι, 
according 
to 
B, 
A 
reading 
μή. 
This 
seems 
to 
point 
to 
B 
in 
Kings 
having 
preserved 
an 
old 
text, 
and 
A 
in 
Kings 
having 
modified 
or 
perhaps 
assimilated 
its 
Greek. 
But 
the 
resemblance, 
on 
this 
minute 
point, 
between 
B 
in 
Kings 
and 
Heb. 
in 
Isaiah 
is 
noteworthy.
τῶν 
ἐθνῶν . . .

Lxx. 
of 
Kings 
has 
τῶν 
γαιῶν...

γαιῶν 
representing 
of 
both 
Heb.

correct

Not

difficult 
to 
give

other 
meaning 
than 
‘the

or 
‘the

perhaps 
rather 
the

XXXVII. 
The 
variations 
in 
ver. 1—4 
are 
not 
extensive, 
and 
Greek 
text 
mainly 
follows 
its 
own 
Heb.: 
as 
in 
the 
order 
of 
the 
phrase 
‘Isaiah, 
the 
son 
of 
Amoz, 
the 
prophet’: 
where 
Heb. 
of 
Kings 
goes 
against 
the 
usual 
rule 
with 
regard 
to 
this 
kind 
of 
phrase.
ὀνειδισμοῦ] 
Lxx. 
of 
Isaiah 
is 
more 
periphrastic 
here 
than 
Kings,  
 and 
inserts 
this 
term, 
making 
four 
against 
three 
of 
Heb. 
Scholz 
marks 
ὀργῆς 
as 
the 
extra 
word: 
but 
the 
comparison 
with 
Kings 
is 
against 
this.
Kings, 
Heb. 
and 
Greek, 
‘all 
the 
words 
of 
R.
Lxx. 
Kings 
continues 
to 
show 
differences 
of 
παιδάρια, 
closer 
to 
Heb., 
for 
πρέσβεις, 
δίδωμι

besides 
some 
minor 
points. 
The 
Hebraism 
μὴ 
φοβηθῇς 
ἀπὸ 
τῶν 
λόγων 
occurs 
in 
both.
Here 
Heb. 
(both) 
and 
um. 
Kings 
are 
nearly 
in 
agreement, 
Kings 
(Heb. 
and 
LXX.) 
inserting 
‘Behold’ 
before 
‘he 
is 
come,’ 
Heb. 
of 
Kings 
alone 
being 
without 
another 
verb 
(‘turned’ 
in 
‘heard’ 
Heb. 
lsai.) 
before 
‘and 
(he) 
sent.
LXX. 
of 
Isaiah 
however 
presents 
considerable 
divergence; 
after 
‘Libnah’ 
it 
continues 
in 
ℵAOQ, 
supported 
in 
the 
main 
by 24 26 49 86 106 198 
and 
partially 
by 
some 
others 
(but 
the 
Lucianic 
MSS. 
are 
substantially 
in 
agreement 
with 
Heb. 
and 
Lxx. 
Kings):

These 
variations 
seem 
due 
to 
confusion 
of 
the 
two 
occurrences 
of 
ἤκουσεν, 
aided 
by 
the 
ﬁrst

of

The 
text 
has 
in 
fact 
been 
shortened 
in 
two 
different 
ways. 
In 
A'
s 
text 
βασιλεὺς 
Ἀσσυρίων 
is 
pretty 
clearly 
an 
iryertion 
for 
clearness. 
For 
if 
the 
subject 
of 
ἤκουσεν 1° 
had 
originally 
stood 
in 
text, 
it 
would 
scarcely 
have 
dropped 
out, 
as 
the 
sentence 
is 
hardly 
clear 
without 
it: 
especially 
as 
it 
appears 
in 
the 
very 
text 
which 
omits 
other 
words 
at 
that 
point. 
It 
would, 
however, 
be 
clearly 
impossible 
in 
the 
text 
as 
B 
has 
it.
Probably 
Lxx. 
lsai. 
originally 
read:

Α

mistake 
repeats 
ἀπέστρεψεν 
instead 
of 
ἀπέστειλεν. 
Heb. 
lsai. 
reads 
what 
corresponds 
to 
καὶ 
ἀκούσας 
ἀπέστειλε. 
Delitzsch 
thinks 
that 
‘heard’ 
is 
a 
mistake 
for 
‘turned’ 
ἐπέστρεψεν 
Kings), 
but 
it 
can 
hardly 
be 
proved.
Θαράθα] 
’s 
spelling 
Θαράκα 
is 
nearer. 
Tirhakah 
is 
named 
only 
here. 
Under 
him 
Ethiopia 
became 
the 
dominant 
power 
along 
the 
Nile, 
with 
influence 
extending 
over 
Egypt 
itself. 
See 
on 
chap. 
xviii.
Οὕτως

Β 
of 
Kings

for 
which 
it 
reads

LXX. 
Kings, 
with 
τοῦ 
ἀναθεματίσαι

is 
more 
exact.
Lxx. 
Isai., 
according 
to 
what 
appears 
to 
be 
the 
better 
text, 
omits 
‘the 
children 
of 
Eden’ 
(though 
the 
Luc. 
Mss. 
insert), 
and 
the 
names 
‘Gozan, 
H. 
and 
R.’ 
thus 
appear 
as 
the 
antecedents 
to 
the 
relative 
clause. 
The 
following 
proper 
name, 
Θαιμὰδ 
Α, 
Θεεμὰθ 
Β, 
Θαιμὰν 
Q, 
may 
have 
been 
conjecturally 
altered: 
but 
the 
Lxx. 
spelling 
of 
unfamiliar 
proper 
names 
is 
so 
erratic, 
that 
no 
inference 
can, 
as 
a 
rule, 
be 
drawn 
from 
it. 
The 
exact 
localities 
of 
‘Eden’ 
and 
‘Telassar’ 
are 
not 
certain: 
as 
Prof. 
Skinner 
points 
out, 
TilAssuri 
(Hill 
of 
Asshur’) 
was 
likely 
to 
occur 
frequently. 
Eden 
is 
said 
to 
have 
been 
a 
small 
kingdom 
on 
the 
Upper 
Euphrates.
Θαιμὰδ] 
On 
Tema 
and 
Teman

Gozan,

about 20 
m. 
south 
of 
the

Lxx.

appear 
to 
have 
transposed 
the 
consonants.
Note 
the 
resemblance

Hena

“A

The

it, 
and 
Hezekiah

up

It 
cannot 
be 
denied 
that 
Lxx. 
Isaiah 
shows 
some 
force 
and 
ﬁtness 
to 
the 
circumstances: 
but 
it 
may 
be 
merely 
due 
to 
a 
slight

Here 
we 
seem 
to 
have 
a 
genuine 
prophecy 
of 
Isaiah

in 
the 
historical 
account. 
The 
crisis 
is 
at 
hand, 
and 
the 
prophecy, 
with 
all 
its 
loftiness, 
is 
unusually 
close 
in 
its 
view 
and 
direct 
in 
its 
language.

In 
xxxii. 10 
the 
people 
were 
warned 
of 
the 
loss 
of 
one 
harvest, 
perhaps 
two. 
Here 
they 
are 
assured 
that 
after 
two

in

they 
must 
subsist 
on 
what 
the

An 
insertion 
of 
LΧΧ. 
Isaiah: 
the 
subject 
is 
left 
unexpressed: 
either 
the 
rare 
survivors, 
or 
inhabitants 
of 
the 
country.
The 
interval 
between 
Sennacherib'
s 
ﬂight 
and 
his 
death 
is 
not 
known, 
but 
the 
statement 
that 
he 
‘dwelt 
at 
Nineveh’ 
suggests 
some 
lapse 
of 
time; 
and 
his 
sons 
must 
have 
reached 
manhood 
at 
his 
death, 
which 
is 
placed 
by 
modern 
authorities, 
according 
to 
the 
Assyrian 
monuments, 
about 681 
B.
C. 
Nineveh 
is 
mentioned 
by 
Isaiah 
only 
in 
this 
place.
Ἀσαρὰχ] 
Νασαρὰχ 
Β 
(Ἐσδρὰχ 
Β, 
Ἐσθρὰχ 
Α 
of 
Kings), 
Heb. 
No 
Assyrian 
god 
of 
the 
name 
is 
known 
from 
any 
other 
source. 
πάτραρχον, 
with 
which 
compare 
Symmachus' 
πάτραρχα 
εἴδωλα 
in 
viii. 21 
suggests 
that 
some 
deity 
of 
the 
King’
s 
family 
or 
clan 
is 
meant.
Esarhaddon 
had 
been 
made 
king 
or 
viceroy 
of 
Babylon 
by 
his  
 father, 
and 
dissension 
had 
brolcen 
out 
in 
the 
royal 
family. 
Adrammelech 
and 
Sharezer 
(only 
the 
former 
is 
named 
in 
secular 
history) 
were 
able 
to 
compass 
the 
murder, 
but 
not 
a 
successful 
revolt. 
Tradition 
makes 
them 
ancestors 
of 
the 
Sassunian 
and 
Arzerunian 
clans 
in 
Armenia (50 
Delitzsch); 
but 
the 
“ten 
Byzantine 
Caesars,” 
headed 
Leo 
(the 
Armenian), 
cannot 
be 
safely 
assigned 
this 
ancestry.
The 
resemblance 
of 
names 
to 
those 
in 
Zech. 
vii. 2 
is 
curious.
Compare 
with 
this 
chapter 
Herodotus’ 
account 
of 
Sennacherib'
s 
expedition 
in 
Bk 11. 
XXXVlll. 
The 
corresponding 
chapter 
of 
Kings 
is 
differently 
arranged, 
and 
does 
not 
contain 
’s 
song 
of 
thanksgiving. 
The 
Heb. 
text 
of 
Kings 
is 
otherwise 
somewhat 
fuller. 
The 
two 
Lxx. 
versions 
differ 
frequently 
in 
choice 
of 
expressions, 
and 
each 
generally 
follows 
its 
own 
Heb. 
See, 
however, 2 
Kings 
xx. 7 
LXX. 
and 
lsai. 
xxxviii. 21 
Heb.
The 
event 
of 
this 
chapter 
seems 
to 
have 
preceded 
Sennacherib'
s 
attack, 
or 
at 
any 
rate 
its 
ﬁnal 
collapse: 
see 
ver. 6. 
The 
chronology 
we 
have 
seen 
to 
be 
a 
matter 
of 
great 
difficulty. 
The 
‘fifteen 
years’ 
added 
to 
Hezekiah'
s 
life, 
and 
the 
twentynine 
years 
assigned 
to 
his 
reign, 
bring 
his 
illness 
to 
the 
fourteenth 
year. 
Modern 
authorities 
have 
put 
forward 
many 
schemes, 
generally 
in 
disagreement 
with 
some, 
at 
any 
rate, 
of 
the 
Biblical 
numbers, 
and 
with 
each 
other. 
Their 
most 
general 
agreement 
is 
in 
assigning 
the 
date 701 
to 
Sennacherib'
s 
invasion: 
yet 
this, 
which 
satisfies 
Assyrian 
chronology, 
is 
too 
early 
for 
Egyptian 
authorities, 
who 
would 
put 
it 
as 
late 
as 687—6. 
Prof. 
W. 
Barnes, 
accepting 
this, 
ingeniously 
gets 
rid 
of 
a 
good 
many 
difficulties 
but 
is 
obliged 
to 
place 
Hezekiah'
s 
accession 
six 
years 
after 
the 
fall 
of 
Samaria, 
instead 
of 
before (2

Cheyne 
here 
quotes 
Jerome 
on 
Ezek. 
xxxiii.; 
“Nec 
statim 
sequitur, 
ut, 
quia 
propheta 
praedicit, 
veniat 
quod 
praedixit. 
Non 
enim 
praedixit 
ut 
veniat, 
sed 
ne ’ 
That 
prophecy 
is 
often 
conditional, 
may 
be 
freely 
granted. 
It 
is 
indeed 
necessary 
to 
its 
moral 
purpose 
that 
it 
should 
be 
so. 
Else 
the 
prophets 
would 
have 
been 
all 
as 
helpless 
as 
Cassandra, 
whenever 
they 
had 
woe 
or 
punishment 
to 
proclaim. 
But 
not 
all 
prophecy 
is 
conditional. 
In 
this 
chapter, 
we  
 understand 
at 
once 
that 
the 
prophecy 
of 
ver. 
I 
was 
conditional, 
we 
are 
equally 
sure 
that 
those 
of 5, 6 
were 
not. 
Ezek. 
iii. 18 
gives 
an 
explanation: 
“When 
I 
say 
unto 
the 
wicked, 
Thou 
shalt 
surely 
die; 
and 
thou 
givest 
him 
not 
warning . . . 
to 
save 
his 
life.’

Used

senses, 
for 
the

So 
the 
Heb. 
The 
exact 
nature 
of 
the 
contrivance 
is 
not 
known. 
The 
commentators 
discuss 
the 
question 
of 
the 
miracle, 
how 
it 
was 
wrought, 
and 
many 
of 
them, 
as 
to 
whether 
there 
was 
any 
miracle 
at 
all. 
All 
that 
need 
be 
here 
asserted 
is, 
that 
the 
Almighty 
can 
both 
alter 
or 
reverse 
any 
process 
of 
nature, 
however 
mighty 
or 
complicated,

also

this

that 
man, 
or

perceive 
such 
a 
deed,

prevent 
them 
from 
perceiving 
it.

apparent 
duplicate 
of 
the 
preceding 
clause, 
or 
from 
ver. 
ἐξῆλθεν 
καὶ 
ἀπῆλθαν] 
Colourless 
verbs: 
Heb. 
‘is 
plucked 
up 
and 
carried 
away’ 
(like 
a 
captive). 
The 
former 
is 
however 
used 
simply 
for 
‘remove’ 
or 
‘depart.’
ὅσπερ 
ὅ 
καταλύων 
σκηνὴν] 
B'
s 
order, 
σκήνην 
καταλύων, 
apparently 
with 
Heb., 
as 
usually. 
The 
participles 
are 
not 
easy 
to 
account 
for, 
καταλύων 
perhaps 
taking 
to 
be 
from 
m 
πήξας 
possibly 
with 
some 
confusion 
of 
the 
Greek 
verb'
s 
meanings: 
it 
applies 
in 
a 
sense 
well 
enough 
to 
a 
‘tent,’ 
but 
Heb. 
has 
no 
suggestion 
of 
such 
a 
meaning 
here. 
Perhaps 
Lxx. 
read 
as 
Nap, 
which 
has 
the 
sense 
of 
‘freeze,’ 
‘set 
hard,’ 
and 
its 
noun 
is 
rendered 
by 
πάγος 
in 
Zech. 
xiv. 
The 
want 
of 
sense 
is 
not 
surprising; 
πήξας 
after 
καταλύων 
is 
odd 
and 
suspicious. 
Lxx. 
probably 
found 
a 
difficulty 
in 
the 
active 
verb 
have 
rolled 
up.’ 
The 
clauses 
are 
differently 
divided 
from 
the 
Heb., 
and 
the 
sense 
is 
lost.
ἐς 
ἱστὸς] 
ἱστὸς 
here = 
the 
‘web,’ 
as 
though 
(participle= 
‘weaver’) 
were 
pointed 
τὸ 
πνεῦμά 
μου 
stands 
for 
Heb. 
‘my 
life.
The 
next 
words 
seem 
to 
be 
a 
guess 
on 
the 
part 
of 
LXX., 
inserted 
to 
give 
a 
connection: 
ἐκτεμεῖν 
corresponding, 
except 
in 
syntax, 
to 
 Heb. 
has 
only 
the 
intervening 
word 
which 
A.
V. 
renders 
‘with 
pining 
sickness’: 
better, 
as 
A.
V. 
marg. 
c., 
‘from 
the 
thrum,’ 
i.
e. 
the 
end 
of 
the 
usedup 
thread.
ἐν 
τῆ 
ἡμέρᾳ 
ἐκείνῃ] 
Heb. 
has 
here, 
as 
again 
below, 
‘from 
day 
to 
night.
παρεδόθην] 
This 
word, 
as 
we 
have 
seen, 
on 
xxiii. 7, 
c. 
(Vol. 
I. 
Introd. 
p. 50) 
is 
frequently 
used 
by 
mm. 
with 
doubtful 
propriety.  
 Here, 
and 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
verse, 
it 
seems 
to 
correspond 
to 
 ‘thou 
wilt 
make 
an 
end 
of 
me’; 
and 
as 
has 
the 
senses 
of 
‘be 
at 
peace,’ 
‘complete,’ 
‘render’ 
(as 
a 
vow), 
and 
almost, 
as 
in 
Arabic 
(see 
Cheyne 
on 
xlii. 19) 
‘devote,’ 
‘surrender,’ 
the 
use 
of 
the 
word 
is 
not 
altogether 
unreasonable 
here.
LXX., 
on 
this 
supposition, 
omit 
‘I 
quieted 
myself,’ 
for 
which 
some 
would 
read 
‘I 
cried,’ 
for 
The 
names 
of 
the 
birds 
are 
better 
inverted 
from 
A.
V. 
They 
occur 
together 
in 
Heb. 
again 
(only) 
in 
Jerem.

Heb. 
‘I

whereas 
the 
Greek 
seems 
to 
represent 
some 
such 
verb 
as. 
or 
The 
two 
parallel 
verbs 
with 
different 
compounds 
resemble 
ἐξῆλθεν

above, 
and 
perhaps 
indicate 
that 
Lxx. 
are 
trying 
to 
gloze 
over 
a 
difficulty. 
καλ 
ἀφείλατό

Heb. 
‘be 
surety 
for 
me,’ 
which 
seems 
have 
been 
read 
by 
Lxx. 
as 
taken 
as 
causal, 
Hiphil 
 ‘took

The 
principal 
Mss. 
of 
LXX. 
omit 
this 
verse 
altogether. 
It 
is 
supplied 
from 
Theodotion, 
in 
V.
ἀνηγγέλη] 
Probably 
represents 
‘they 
declared’ 
for 
 ‘they 
live.’ 
Heb. 
is 
obscure, 
and 
mm. 
in 
difficulties. 
σοι 
may 
be 
 out 
of 
as 
Lxx. 
omits 
‘in

as 
well 
as 
the 
ﬁrst 
clause 
of 
ver.

mgV 36

ἰδοὺ

εἵλου] 
Seemingly 1152211 
for 
’n, 
a 
reading 
which 
some 
have 
proposed 
in 
the 
Heb. 
So 
also 
Vulg. 
eruisti. 
It 
may 
however 
be 
an 
interpretation 
of 
Heb., 
like 
A.
V., 
the 
literal 
rendering 
being 
‘thou 
hast 
loved 
my 
soul 
from 
the 
pit,’ 
i.
e. 
with 
extension 
of 
the 
verb'
s 
meaning, 
‘loved 
so 
as 
to 
deliver,
οἱ 
ἐν 
ᾅδου] 
Lxx. 
abandon 
the 
attempt 
at 
three 
parallels; 
this 
phrase 
stands 
the 
ﬁrst 
time 
for 
‘Sheol,’ 
the 
second 
time 
for 
‘they 
that 
go 
down 
to 
the 
pit.
The 
latter 
part 
of 
the 
verse 
is 
paraphrased. 
Possibly 
the 
translator 
was 
thinking 
of 
Hezekiah'
s 
supposed 
childlessness 
up 
to 
the 
time 
of 
his 
illness.
δικαιοσύνην] 
Heb. 
‘thy 
truth’ 
or 
‘faithfulness’: 
rendered 
loosely 
by 
ἐλεημοσύνην 
at 
end 
of 
previous 
verse.

θεὲ 
B 
(alone 
or 
nearly 
so) 
Heb. 
lit. 
‘The 
Lord 
to 
save 
me.’ 
The 
rest 
of 
the 
verse 
is 
slightly 
paraphrased 
and 
extended 
by 
um.
In 
Kings, 
these 
verses 
stand 
after 
ver. 6, 
and 
many 
modern 
authorities 
consider 
them 
misplaced 
here. 
The 
pluperfects 
of 
A. 
V 
are 
objected 
to, 
on 
grammatical 
grounds. 
Α 
wide 
view 
as 
to 
corresponding 
usages 
of 
language 
may 
be 
needed 
to 
justify 
them: 
but 
the 
order 
of 
’s 
narrative 
is 
not 
bound 
to 
conform 
to 
modern 
ideas 
of 
arrangement.
The 
application 
of 
a 
lump 
of 
ﬁgs, 
used 
as 
a 
poultice, 
was 
a 
recognised 
mode 
of 
treatment. 
Yet 
here 
its 
use 
need 
not 
differ 
from 
that 
of 
the 
clay 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
blind 
man, 
John 
ix. 6. 
It 
may 
be 
as 
much 
sign 
as 
agent. 
The 
description 
of 
’s 
disease 
has 
suggested 
to 
some 
the 
plague, 
supposed 
therefore 
to 
be 
the 
same 
that 
destroyed 
Sennacherib'
s 
army. 
The 
evidence 
is 
lacking 
in 
either 
case. 
Leprosy 
(Lev. 
xiii. 18) 
has 
also 
been 
suggested. 
Certainly 
this 
disease 
was 
especially 
to 
be 
regarded 
as 
directly 
inflicted 
by 
God, 
and 
as 
a 
type 
of 
sin, 
clinging 
and 
consuming, 
or 
removed.
Λάβε] 
Heb. 
of 
Isaiah

Heb. 
(but 
not 
LXX.) 
of 
Kings, 
‘Berodach.’
This 
Merodach 
had 
a 
small 
principality 
in 
S. 
Babylonia, 
starting 
from 
which, 
by 
constant 
struggles, 
he 
made 
himself 
king 
of 
Babylonia, 
in 
the 
ancient 
capital. 
Under 
Sargon 
he 
maintained 
himself 
as 
a 
nominal 
but 
disobedient 
vassal 
of 
Assyria 
for 
eleven 
years, 
when 
he 
openly 
revolted: 
thenceforward 
he 
carried 
on 
intrigue 
and 
warfare 
for 
a 
long 
time, 
but 
seems 
to 
have 
reigned 
at 
Babylon 
again 
only 
for 
a 
few 
months 
during 
’s 
reign, 
until 
finally 
crushed 
by 
him. 
His 
adventurous 
career 
lasted 
for 
something 
like 
thirty 
years; 
some 
authorities 
assign 
the 
later

of

which

with 
its 
obvious 
resemblance 
to 
the 
present 
verse.
τοῦ

Transliterated 
from 
the 
Heb. 
in 
both 
Lxx. 
texts. 
This 
practice 
is 
more 
common 
in 
other 
parts 
of 
the 
Bible, 
especially 
Kings, 
than 
in 
the 
Prophets. 
Theodotion 
was 
much 
given 
to 
it 
(see 
Swete, 
Introd. 
to 0. 
T. 
in 
Greek, 
p. 46). 
The 
Heb. 
word, 
according 
to 
the 
best 
authorities, 
means 
‘treasury’; 
though 
some 
have 
taken 
it 
as 
equivalent 
to 11823, 
a 
kind 
of 
spice: 
hence, 
perhaps, 
the 
extra 
term 
τῆς

in 
LXX. 
of 
Isaiah, 
which 
may 
be 
a 
duplicate. 
The 
order 
varies 
in 
the 
MSS., 
ℵAQ

some

mostly 
Hesychian, 
placing 
the

B, 
in

omits 
this

Hezekiah'
s 
fault (2 
Chron.

was 
pride, 
and 
that 
he 
owed 
all, 
his 
very 
existence, 
to 
God. 
His 
repentance 
was 
sincere, 
and 
the 
evil 
was 
not 
to 
fall 
in 
his 
day; 
his 
son'
s 
doings 
aggravated 
the 
ill 
beyond 
earthly 
pardon. 
His 
answer 
to 
Isaiah 
is 
simply 
resigned 
thankfulness 
for 
the 
postponement.
δικαιοσύνη] 
See 
on 
xxxviii. 
XL. 
The 
previous 
chapter 
of 
history 
has 
directed 
our 
attention 
to 
Babylon. 
The 
portion 
of 
the 
Book 
which 
follows—
chh. 
xl.—
lxvi., 
or 
the 
greater 
part 
of 
them—
has 
been 
generally 
admitted 
to 
refer 
to 
captivity 
in 
Babylonia, 
and 
the 
deliverance 
from 
it. 
Many 
modern 
critics 
hold, 
as 
is 
well 
known, 
that 
these 
chapters 
were 
composed 
by 
an 
unknown 
prophet 
(or 
prophets), 
long 
after 
’s 
death, 
toward 
the 
close 
of 
the 
Exile—
some 
portions, 
indeed, 
later 
again. 
allege 
differences 
of 
style, 
language, 
and 
standpoint, 
between 
these 
chapters 
and 
those 
which 
they 
acknowledge 
as 
Isaiah'
s 
work; 
consider 
it 
unlikely 
or 
impossible 
that 
he 
should 
have 
looked 
so 
far 
into 
the 
future, 
and 
away 
from 
his 
own 
time; 
with 
so 
much 
detail, 
moreover, 
as 
to 
mention 
Cyrus 
by 
name. 
The 
question 
is 
too 
wide 
and 
complicated 
for 
discussion 
here: 
and 
it 
is 
not 
necessary 
for 
our 
immediate 
purpose 
to 
enter 
upon 
it, 
as 
the 
Greek 
translator 
shows 
no  
 sign 
of 
any 
idea 
that 
the 
sixtysix 
chapters 
of 
the 
book 
are 
not 
alike 
Isaiah'
s 
work. 
Nor, 
it 
may 
be 
noticed, 
does 
the 
author 
of 
Ecclesiasticus. 
The 
ﬁrst 
doubt 
on 
the 
subject 
seems 
to 
have 
been 
expressed 
by 
lbn 
Ezra 
in 
the 
twelfth 
century 
A.
D.; 
and 
not 
again 
until 
the 
eighteenth 
century, 
when 
the 
modern 
views 
were 
put 
forward 
by 
the 
German 
school 
of 
whom 
Gesenius, 
Hitzig 
and 
Ewald 
are 
the 
chief 
names. 
These 
views 
are 
probably 
held, 
in 
one 
form 
or 
another, 
by 
a 
majority 
of 
the 
authorities 
and 
students 
of 
the 
present 
day. 
It 
is 
perhaps 
therefore 
proper 
for 
the 
writer 
of 
these 
notes 
to 
state 
that 
he 
is 
not 
convinced 
by 
them, 
but 
holds 
that, 
substantially, 
the 
whole 
of 
the 
‘Book 
of 
Isaiah’ 
is 
the 
work 
of 
that 
prophet, 
and 
that 
the 
work 
of 
the 
modern 
‘critics,’ 
while 
of 
immense 
value 
as 
a 
contribution 
to 
knowledge 
of 
details, 
is 
a 
failure 
as 
to 
the 
broad 
issues 
involved.
παρακαλεῖτε

The 
Heb. 
is 
transitive 
(Piel); 
the 
rendering 
of 
Α. 
V. 
is 
correct, 
and 
the 
punctuation 
should 
be 
observed. 
The 
vocative 
in 
Vulg., 
consolamini, 
popule

opens 
the 
door 
to 
some 
confusion. 
The

indeed, 
all

Φωνὴ

Literal. 
Many

if

interjection: 
‘Hark !

this

so 
all 
four 
Evangelists 
quote 
it. 
So 
also 
Jewish 
interpreters 
and 
Targ., 
according 
to 
Delitzsch: 
but 
the 
Heb.

join 
it 
with 
‘Prepare,’ 
giving 
a 
parallelism.

probably

The

then 
be 
the

of 
Job

The

clause, 
are 
omitted 
bv 
LXX.
ῥοπὴ 
[υγοῦ] 
Heb. 
‘a 
grain 
of 
the 
scales.’ 
The 
regular 
Greek 
idea 
of 
the 
impulse 
which 
just 
turns 
the 
scale 
is 
successfully 
adapted. 
See 
Soph. 
Oed. 
Tyr. 961, 
Track. 82, 
Aesch. 
Perm: 437, 
c. 
The 
actual 
combination 
of 
ῥοπὴ 
and 
ζυγὸν 
in 
one 
phrase 
is 
not, 
however, 
familiar 
from 
classical 
literature.
ὃς

LXX., 
omitting 
‘isles,’ 
evidently 
read 
σίελος 
for 
‘a 
grain 
of 
dust,’ 
‘ﬁne 
dust.’ 
λογισθήσονται 
repeats 
the 
former 
verb 
instead 
of 
‘he 
will

which 
word 
is 
rendered, 
though 
there 
not 
quite 
rightly, 
in

read

shortens 
the 
verse 
into 
a 
bald 
form, 
but 
presents 
the 
general 
sense.
As 
in 
ver. 11, 
only 
two 
of 
the 
three 
words 
are 
cognate 
in 
Heb.

The

read 
as 
the 
interrog. 
prefix: 
similar 
in 
form 
περιεχρύσουν] 
The 
Heb. 
word 
is 
akin 
to 
that 
used 
above 
for 
‘smelter’ 
χρυσοχόος). 
Lxx. 
omit 
‘silver 
chains.’ 
The 
passage 
is 
difficult.
ὁμοίωμα] 
Heb. 
begins 
a 
fresh 
verse 
at 
this 
point, 
with 
the 
obscure 
phrase 
noiwn 
pom, 
of 
which 
the 
best 
rendering 
forthcoming 
is, 
‘He 
that 
is 
impoverished 
as 
to 
an 
offering.’ 
The 
not. 
throws 
no 
light 
on 
this 
as 
it 
stands. 
Prof. 
Skinner 
suggests 
that 
 was 
read 
by 
them 
as 
‘likeness’; 
but 
the 
order 
of 
words 
is 
against 
this: 
and 
it 
is 
perhaps 
more 
probable 
that 
ὁμοίωμα 
is 
due 
to 
the 
context, 
either 
being 
a 
guess 
for 13073.1, 
or 
having 
taken 
the 
place 
of 
the 
rendering 
of 
it: 
and 
that 
κατεσκεύασεν 
represents 
read 
perhaps 
as 
town, 
from 
in 
sense 
‘set ’ 
is 
itself 
completely 
obscure, 
Vulg. 
rendering 
the 
phrase 
‘Forte 
lignum 
et 
imputribile,’ 
and 
Jerome 
explaining 
the 
word 
of 
durable 
wood!

cf. 
Wisdom

but, 
as 
there

possibly 
right, 
though 
against 
the

Heb. 
ABBREV, 
‘ﬁne

‘gauze,’ 
is 
closely 
connected 
with 
the 
word 
used 
in 
ver. 15 
for 
‘dust.’
The 
syntax 
differs 
from 
Heb., 
‘judges’ 
having 
been 
transferred, 
as 
a 
verb, 
to 
the 
first 
clause, 
with 
some 
misreading.

‘confusion,’

so, 
nothingness.

The 
Heb. 
has 
passive 
verbs, 
but 
one 
being 
Niphal 
of 
a 
verb 
beginning 
with 
ABBREV, 
and 
the 
other 
a 
Pual, 
they 
do 
not 
differ 
in 
the 
consonantal 
text 
from 
active 
forms.

Heb. 
‘I

from 
ABBREV). 
LXX. 
probably 
took 
it 
from 
ABBREV 
ABBREV

perhaps 
confusion 
with 
the 
ﬁrst 
word 
of 
ver. 26 
tended 
to 
this.

(as 
Eurip. 
Ion 1263,

So 
in 
xli. 20, 
xliii. 15, 
this

is 
used 
to

‘create.’ 
Cf.

those

The 
discrepancy 
Heb. 
and 
Lxx. 
here 
is 
well 
known, 
and 
the 
quotation, 
Matt. 
xii. 18 
foll., 
complicates 
matters 
more. 
In 
the 
first 
place, 
Heb. 
has 
no 
mention 
here 
of 
‘jacob’

‘Istael.’ 
Scholz 
supports

here,

that

that

probably

other

their 
omission

Matthew

except 
for

with 
LXX. 
εἷς 
νῖκος 
is 
however 
found 
in 
Theod. 
(and 
Aq. 
also, 
xxv. 8), 
but 
also 
in 
LXX., 
as 2 
Sam. 
ii. 26, 
Amos 
i. 11, 
viii. 7, 
c. 
for 
or 
This 
passage 
is 
discussed 
at 
length 
by 
Dr 
Hatch, 
Essay: 
in 
Bibl. 
Greek, 
IV. 
pp. 199 
foIl., 
with 
special 
reference 
to 
the 
quotations 
in 
Justin, 
Dial. 
Tryph. 123, 135. 
These 
agree 
with 
Lxx. 
in 
inserting 
Ἰακώβ, 
Ἰσραήλ, 
and 
in 
some 
other 
respects, 
while 
varying 
generally 
between 
Lxx. 
and 
the 
text 
as 
given 
in 
’s 
quotation. 
In 
estimating 
the 
evidence 
of 
Patristic 
quotations 
of 
the 
passage, 
the 
question 
must 
be 
taken 
into 
account, 
whether 
they 
quote 
from 
Isaiah 
or 
Mat. 
thew, 
or 
confuse 
the 
two. 
It 
is 
worth 
while 
to 
notice 
Tertullian, 
adv. 
Praxean, 
who 
is 
decidedly 
against 
LXX.; 
Accipe 
igitur 
et 
alias 
voces 
patris 
de 
filio 
per 
Esaiam: 
Ecce 
filius 
mus 
quem 
elegi, 
dilectus 
mat: 
in 
quem 
bane 
semi.
The 
conclusion 
seems 
to 
be, 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
main 
quotation: 
(a) 
that 
LXX. 
are 
wrong 
in 
inserting 
Ἰακώβ...
Ἰσραήλ: 
(b) 
that 
Matthew 
quoted 
either 
loosely 
from 
Heb. 
and 
Lxx. 
alternately, 
or 
from 
an 
older 
form 
of 
Lxx., 
which 
Theodotion 
may 
have 
used. 
(This 
is 
more 
likely 
than 
an 
alternative 
Hebrew: 
but 
’s 
source 
may 
have 
been 
a 
loosely 
put 
together 
collection 
of 
prophecies): 
(c) 
that 
later 
quotations 
of 
the 
passage 
are 
likely 
to 
be 
confused, 
either 
originally 
or 
in 
transcrition 
from 
the 
three 
main 
sources, 
Isai. 
Heb., 
Isai. 
Lxx., 
and 
Matthew.
προσεδέξατο] 
εὐδόκησεν 
Matt., 
Theod. 
Kay 
points 
out 
that 
the 
Heb. 
word 
is 
used 
of 
’s 
acceptance 
of 
sacrifice 
(Lev. 
i. 3, 4, 
&amp;
c.).
κρίσιν] 
Heb. 
‘judgment,’ 
the 
usual 
word: 
but 
high 
authorities 
give 
it 
here 
a 
rather 
special 
sense; 
as, 
substantially, 
the 
true 
religion 
viewed 
as 
a 
rule 
or 
system.
οὗ

omitted 
by 
Cypr.

thus 
in

yet 
as 
the

in 
all 
these 
four 
places, 
it 
may 
be 
doubted 
whether

not 
the 
real 
reading. 
See 
on 
i. 
ἀκουσθήσεται] 
Heb. 
verb 
is 
causal.
εἰς 
ἀλήθειαν] 
So 
the 
Heb. 
but 
Matt. 
has 
εἰς 
νἰκος. 
This 
(see 
above) 
is 
a 
regular 
rendering 
of 
which 
is 
εἷς 
τέλος, 
Hab. 
i. 4 
this 
has 
some 
verbal 
resemblance 
to 
the 
present 
clause, 
so 
that 
Matthew 
might 
conceivably 
have 
dropped 
into 
Habakkuk'
s 
wording. 
The 
two 
expressions, 
at 
any 
rate, 
come 
near 
to 
touching 
one 
another 
at 
this 
point: 
but 
as 
Heb. 
and 
met. 
agree, 
it 
need 
not 
be 
further 
discussed 
here. 
Justin 
quotes 
once 
with 
ἀλήθειαν 
and 
once 
with 
νῖκος.
ἀνακάμψα...
οὐ 
θραυσθήσεται] 
Lxx. 
substitutes 
a 
positive 
expression 
for 
Heb. 
‘he 
shall 
not 
burn 
dimly’: 
the 
two 
expressions 
‘burn 
dimly,’ 
‘be 
bruised,’ 
being 
repeated 
in 
Heb. 
from 
ver. 3. 
To 
Vulg, 
and 
A.
V. 
give 
no 
clue.
καὶ 
ἐπὶ 
τῷ 
όνόματι 
αὐτοῦ 
ἔθνη 
ἐπλιοῦσιν] 
It 
is 
doubtful 
Whether 
this 
clause 
in 
Heb. 
is 
independent, 
or 
still 
subordinate 
to 
‘until,’ 
but 
the 
former 
view 
is 
perhaps 
more 
usual. 
Here 
(see 
above) 
Matthew 
practically 
agrees 
with 
LXX., 
and 
so 
Justin, 
with 
ὄνομα, 
ἔθνη 
for 
‘law,’ 
‘isles. 
Aq. 
Symm. 
Theod. 
have 
νόμος, 
νῆσοι. 
ἔθνη 
is 
used 
above 
for 
‘isles. 
Dim, 
xli. 5: 
and 
ὀνόματι 
is 
possibly 
corrupted 
from 
νόμῳ. 
More 
likely 
it 
is 
a 
paraphrase, 
cf. 
xxvi. 8, 
lxiii. 16, 19. 
Dr 
Hatch, 
in 
his 
discussion 
of 
the 
passage, 
remarks 
that 
the 
agreement 
of 
early 
recensions 
of 
the 
Lxx. 
“seems 
to 
point 
to 
a 
lost 
variant 
in 
the 
Hebrew 
text.” 
is 
perhaps 
more 
than 
the 
facts 
indicate.
στερεώσας] 
Heb. 
‘to 
beat 
out,’ 
as 
into 
thin 
plates, 
but 
a 
further 
notion 
of 
‘compacting,’ 
or 
at 
least 
preserving 
compactness. 
The 
Lxx. 
generally 
use 
στερεόω, 
στερέωμα, 
for 
this 
verb 
and 
noun; 
and 
from 
the 
Lat. 
firmamentum 
comes 
our 
rendering 
in 
Gen. 
i. 7, 
c 
The 
same 
verb 
is 
used 
in 
XI. 19, 
of 
the 
plating 
over 
of 
the 
idol. 
It 
is 
perhaps 
this 
view 
of 
the 
word 
that 
led 
to 
the 
rendering 
πήξας 
just 
above, 
where 
Heb. 
is 
strictly 
‘stretched 
out.
εἰς 
ᾠοῖς 
ἐθνὼν] 
Β* 
omits. 
Cf. 
xlix. 6, 
ἀρετὰς] 
Here 
and 
in 
ver. 12, 
used 
much 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
Lat. 
laudes=
praiseworthy 
deeds. 
There 
is 
none 
like 
Him, 
or 
approaching  
 Him. 
The 
heathen 
sometimes 
groped 
after 
this 
idea: 
e.
g. 
Aesch. 
Agam. 164, 
οὐκ 
ἔχω 
προσεικάσαι,
πάντ’ 
ἐπισταθμώμενος,
πλὴν 
Διός,
 and 
Horace, 
0d. 1. 
xii. 18, 
“Nec 
viget 
quicquam 
simile 
aut 
secundum.’
ἀνατεῖλαι] 
So 
AQ 26; 
ἀναγγεῖλαι 
is 
the 
usual 
reading, 
but 
pretty 
clearly 
due 
to 
carelessness 
or 
early 
corruption, 
and 
perhaps 
corrected 
again. 
Cf. 
xlv. 
ἐδηλώθη] 
Heb. 
has 
causal 
of 
which 
is 
often 
rendered 
inexactly.
ἡ 
ἀρχὴ 
αὐτοῦ] 
ἀρχὴ 
is 
almost 
certainly, 
as 
Scholz 
gives 
it, 
‘his 
beginning’ 
for 
‘his 
praises.’ 
What 
to 
be 
the 
intention 
of 
the 
phrase 
is 
another 
question: 
perhaps 
‘His 
is 
the 
dominion’: 
or 
possibly, 
more 
prosaically, 
as 
a 
direction, 
beginning 
of 
it,’ 
i.
e. 
of 
the 
song. 
δοξάζετε 
τὸ 
ὄνομα 
αὐτοῦ 
appears 
to 
be 
a 
duplicate 
rendering 
with 
the 
right 
reading: ℵ* 
omits 
the 
words.
εὐθρανθητι] 
Perhaps 
for 
Cf. 
xxxv. 
I.
κῶμαι] 
LXX. 
seem 
to 
have 
thought 
that 
the 
‘wilderness’ 
could 
not 
contain 
‘cities.’ 
It 
is 
doubtful 
whether 
‘Sela,’ 
if 
taken, 
with 
R.
V., 
as 
a 
proper 
name—
cf. 
xvi. 
I, 
is 
to 
be 
identified 
with 
Petra 
or 
not. 
also 2 
Kings 
xiv. 7. 
Delitzsch 
takes 
the 
‘Rockcity’ 
to 
be 
a 
instance 
of 
the 
cities 
meant: 
others 
think 
that 
settlements 
in 
the 
cases 
are 
referred 
to.
συντρίψει 
πόλεμον] 
Scholz 
gives 
‘like 
a 
man 
of 
war’ 
as 
matter 
in 
Heb. 
But 
Mr 
Thackeray 
has 
pointed 
out 
(foam. 
of 
Theol) 
Studies, 
July 1903) 
that 
this 
phrase 
is 
used 
where 
Heb. 
has 
‘a 
man 
of 
war’ 
also 
in 
Exod. 
xv. 3, 
the 
Greek 
Isaiah 
and 
Exodus 
showing 
certain 
affinities. 
(For 
the 
idea 
expressed 
by 
the 
Greek, 
cf. 
Ps. 
xlvi. 9 
lxxvi. 3.) 
It 
is 
therefore 
scarcely 
needful 
to 
suggest 
that 
Lxx. 
read 
‘shall 
trample 
on,’ 
‘subdue,’ 
for 
‘like 
a
ἀεὶ] 
Corresponds 
to 
Heb. 
‘from 
of 
old’: 
and 
so 
Vulg. 
semper. 
The 
rhetorical 
question 
is 
not 
in 
Heb., 
though, 
with 
some 
confusion, 
the 
Hiphil 
prefix 
of 
the 
first 
verb 
may 
have 
been 
read 
as 
the 
interrogative 
sign. 
Lxx. 
are, 
however, 
very 
occasionally, 
prone 
to 
enliven 
the 
style 
of 
the 
original: 
see 
lxv. 24, 
ἐρῶ 
Τί 
ἐστίν.
ἐκστῆσαι] 
Heb. 
verb 
means 
‘astonish’ 
as 
well 
as 
‘lay 
waste.’ 
dissipato. 
R. 
V. 
however 
takes 
this 
and 
following 
verb 
as 
intrans.; 
‘I 
gasp 
and 
pant.
The 
ﬁrst 
part 
of 
this 
verse 
is 
omitted 
in 
LXX., 
according 
to  
 ℵAQΓ 26 41 49 91 106 198: 
B 
ἃς. 
have 
it 
inserted 
from 
the 
Hexapla 
(Symm. 
Theod.).
ῥήματα] 
Heb. 131 
signifying 
a 
‘thing,’ 
‘matter,’ 
as 
well 
as 
a 
‘word‘ 
(haec 
verba 
Vulg.). 
This 
is 
sometimes 
imitated 
in 
the 
Greek; 
compare 
λογόν, 
x. 22, 23, 
with 
πράγματα, 
xxviii. 
αὐτοὶ 
δὲ 
ἀπεστράφησαν...
ὀπίαω] 
This 
clause 
is 
referred 
by 
LXX. 
to 
the 
τυφλοὶ 
of 
ver. 16, 
with 
a 
resemblance 
to 
i. 4, 
where 
it 
will 
be 
noted 
that 
Lxx. 
omitted 
the 
similar 
clause. 
In 
Heb. 
it 
refers 
to 
the 
idolaters, 
the 
verse 
being 
complete 
in 
itself: 
which 
seems 
clearly 
rig 
ht. 
ght.
ιδεῖν] 
Heb. 
inf. 
with 
καὶ 
τίει] 
καὶ 
seems 
to 
have 
something 
of 
its 
classical 
force 
with 
the 
interrogative: 
‘Ναγ, 
who...?’ 
The 
English 
‘and’ 
has 
a 
similar 
tendency: 
e.
g. 
Spenser, 
Faerie 
Queene, 
Bk 
II. 
Canto 
viii. 
l. 1, 
“And 
is 
there 
care 
in 
heaven? 
and 
is 
there 
love
In 
heavenly 
spirits,” 
spirits, 
&amp;
c.“
 or 
Byron, 
“And 
wilt 
thou 
weep, 
when 
I 
am 
low?’
οἱ 
κυριεύοωγες 
αὐτὸν] 
Heb. 
‘my 
messenger 
that 
I 
send,’ 
the 
being 
probably 
the 
not 
uncommon 
one 
between 
‘king 
and 
‘messenger.’ 
Heb. 
is 
clearly 
right, 
and 
the 
error 
of 
Lxx. 
probably 
involved 
the 
suppression 
of 
‘that 
I 
send.’ 
The 
next 
a 
very 
doubtful 
one 
in 
Heb., 
as 
to 
its 
exact 
meaning 
(Who 
is 
blind 
as 
the 
surrendered 
one?) 
is 
omitted 
by 
LXX., 
Theodotion 
having 
τίς 
τυφλὸς 
ὡς 
ὁ 
ἀπεσχηκώς; 
and 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
Lxx. 
were 
further 
confused 
by 
the 
recurrence 
of 
‘blind,’ 
and 
an 
idea 
that 
meant 
‘their 
ruler.
The 
numbers 
and 
persons 
of 
the 
verbs 
are 
changed 
in 
Lxx.
ἐβουλεύσατο] 
Q 
and 
most 
cursives 
read 
ἐβούλετο, 
which 
in 
some 
ways 
corresponds 
better 
with 
Heb. 
‘was 
pleased,’ 
cf. 
liii. 
the 
construction 
with 
ἵνα 
after 
βούλομαι 
is 
perhaps 
awkward, 
but 
cf., 
e.
g., 
Mark 
vi. 25, 
john 
xvii. 
ἵνα

Either 
paraphrased, 
or 
taken 
as 
a 
verb: 
Vulg.

αἴγεσιν] 
Probably 
read 
for 
(Lowth).
καὶ 
ἴδον, 
καὶ 
ἐγένετο] 
Ver. 21 
in 
Heb. 
ends 
with 
‘and 
make 
it 
glorious,’ ‘18‘1. 
This 
Lxx. 
prob. 
read 
as 
‘and 
I 
saw,’ 
‘and 
it 
(is)’ 
was 
taken 
for 
‘and 
it 
came 
to

Heb. 
is 
now 
generally 
taken 
as 
a 
verb 
(infin.), 
whose 
form  
 presents 
some 
difficulty, 
but 
Vulg. 
also 
read 
it 
as 
a 
noun 
with 
art. 
So 
Vulg., 
laqueus 
iuvenum, 
iuvenum 
being 
due 
to 
taking 
before 
as 
part 
of 
the 
root: 
for 
see 
on 
ἐκλεκτοί,

πανταχοῦ 
is 
a 
loose 
rendering, 
apparently 
to 
suit

It 
would 
be 
possible 
to 
punctuate 
as 
in 
Heb., 
with 
a 
stop 
after 
ἐξαιρούμενος, 
taking 
ἅρπαγμα 
as 
parallel 
to 
προνομὴν 
in 
construction.

this 
gives 
no 
sense, 
and 
about 25 
cursives 
support

whose 
text 
agrees 
with 
Heb.

suggests 
that 
the

lurks, 
in 
a 
corrupted 
form, 
in

vii. 18, 
xviii. 7: 
but 
the 
construction, 
and 
the 
general 
reference 
in

are 
against 
this.

Probably 
they

it

the

Heb. 
‘I

The 
sense 
of 
Greek 
can 
scarcely 
be 
right. 
Some, 
indeed, 
have 
suspected 
that 
the 
Heb. 
text 
should 
have 
either 
two, 
or 
four

but 
Lxx. 
are 
against 
this. 
Perhaps 
they 
read

should 
the

The

So

pointed,

many

Others, 
however, 
read 
it 
(with 
alteration 
of 
vowelpoint) 
as 
‘bars’: 
Vulg. 
water, 
and 
Theodotion: 
and 
this 
A.

‘nobles.’ 
See

ἐν

is 
the 
reading 
of 
ℵcaA 
and 
A'
s 
faithful 
companions 26 
and 106. 
κλαίοις 
is 
however 
certainly 
a 
corruption, 
or 
rather 
an 
alteration, 
to 
suit 
δεθήσονται, 
which 
is 
the 
reading 
of 
all 
MSS.

one. 
This 
one, 305, 
reads 
δεηθήσονται, 
which 
Dr 
Field 
printed 
in 
his 1859 
edition, 
pointing 
out 
that 
δέησις 
is 
a 
regular 
rendering 
of

in 
jerem. 
xi. 14, 
Ps. 
xvii. 1, 
c.: 
Heb. 
probably 
meaning 
‘their 
shouting,’ 
whether 
in 
joy 
or 
sorrow. 
seems 
almost 
conclusive: 
else 
it 
might 
have 
seemed 
likely 
that 
Lxx. 
for 
read 
as 
in 
Nahum 
iii. 
to, 
or 
cf. 
Micah 
i. 13. 
But 
this 
is 
needless, 
and 
the 
nor. 
appears 
to 
support 
the 
Heb. 
text.
The 
passage 
is 
so 
obscure 
that 
a 
historical 
reference 
is 
hardly 
traceable, 
more 
than 
that 
some 
calamity 
to 
the 
Chaldaeans 
is 
indicated, 
previous 
to 
the 
setting 
free 
of 
Israel.

xlii. 8, 
The 
Greek 
changes 
the

correspondingly 
the 
object) 
of 
the 
verbs, 
and 
takes 
the 
second 
verb

causal.

difference 
amounts 
only 
to

Scholz 
gives 
this 
as 
read 
for 
οὐκ 
ἐμοὶ] 
Heb. 
and 
the 
later 
versions 
have 
‘Thou 
broughtest

but 
the 
omission 
of 
the 
verb 
is 
at 
least 
old, 
see 
the 
quotation 
from 
Irenaeus 
below.

it

be 
that

This 
reading 
agrees 
better 
with 
Heb., 
and 
the 
persons 
of 
the 
verbs, 
as 
already 
seen, 
may 
have 
been 
confused. 
Moreover 
’s 
order, 
generally 
so 
close 
to 
Heb., 
seems 
right, 
as 
προέστης 
must 
be 
read 
as 
Irenaeus 
(Lat. 
transl., 
Adv. 
Haer. 
IV. 17), 
gives 
the 
passage 
thus: 
non

non

a

others 
think 
the

Heb. 
‘with

probably: 
but 
the 
means 
to 
‘pierce’ 
or 
‘bore’ 
through, 
and 
Lxx. 
probably 
intends 
‘a

ℵ*B

the

Gesenius, 
to 
illustrate 
this 
passage, 
quoted 
Virg. 
Georg. 
IV. 174 
(cf.

“llli

He 
labours 
and 
“exhausts 
his 
strength 
in

contrast 
xl. 31” 
(Skinner). 
The 
same 
contrast 
is 
in 
xlvi. 
This 
passage 
works 
out 
further 
the 
idea 
of 
XI. 19 
foll.: 
just 
as, 
e.
g., 
chaps. 
ν. 
and 
xxxi. 
deal 
with 
ideas 
previously 
introduced.
ἐκλαξεμενος] 
This 
word 
takes 
the 
place 
of 
‘is 
faint’ 
at 
end 
ver. 12 
of 
Heb. 
It 
may 
be 
a 
guess, 
cf. 
xl. 20. 
(Can 
Lxx. 
have 
read 
for 
τιν’ 
and 
rendered 
thus?)
τίκτων 
ξύλον 
corresponds 
to 
Heb. 
‘craftsman 
in 
wood,’ 
μέτρῳ 
to 
‘stretcheth 
out 
a 
line.’ 
If 
ἐν 
κόλλῃ 
ἐρύθμισεν 
αὐτὸ 
stands, 
seems 
likely, 
for 
‘marketh 
it 
with 
a 
pencil,’ 
the 
next 
two 
clauses 
omitted 
by 
not. 
(so 
Scholz); 
but 
there 
is 
so 
little 
verbal 
resemblance 
that 
even 
the 
correspondence 
of 
the 
clauses 
is 
scarcely 
beyond 
doubt.
This 
verse 
is 
mutilated 
in 
LXX., 
which 
perhaps 
skipped 
from 
‘cedars’ 
to 
the 
word 
(pine?) 
found 
only 
here, 
and 
with 
some 
doubt 
as 
to 
the 
text. 
ὃ, 
in 
ℵAQ 
before 
ἔκοψεν, 
seems 
to 
be 
an 
unfortunate

and 
οὗ 
τὸ 
ἥμισυ, 
ver. 16. 
ὁ 
ἐφύτευσεν 
Κύριος 
may 
be 
an 
attempt 
to 
render 
some 
of 
the 
missing 
words 
of 
the 
verse; 
but 
it 
suggests 
a 
reminiscence 
of 
Ps. 
civ. 
ἵνα. 
This 
is 
a 
possible 
way 
of 
rendering 
Heb. 
(pf. 
with 
conversive), 
though 
it 
looks 
very 
different 
from 
A.
V. 
‘Then 
shall 
it 
be...’ 
It 
is 
not, 
however, 
the 
best 
way 
to 
render
αὐτοὺς] 
After 
this 
Lxx. 
omit 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
verse, 
which 
practically 
repeats 
the 
preceding 
clause 
in 
parallel 
phraseology. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
τὸ 
δὲ 
λοιπὸν 
is 
an 
insertion; 
there 
seems 
to 
be 
confusion 
with 
the 
beginning 
of 
ver. 17. 
In 
fact 
the 
rendering 
of 
ver. 1517 
shows 
signs 
of 
general 
confusion, 
and 
the 
texts 
of 
the 
principal 
uncials 
vary 
considerably.

also 
has 
apparently 
a 
confused 
insertion 
from 
ver. 19, 
giving 
the 
appearance 
of 
a 
duplicate 
rendering.
The 
suggestion 
that 
ἐπ’

is 
due 
to 
duplicating 
‘bread,’ 
as 
(Scholz), 
is 
of

possible,

scarcely 
to 
be

on

the

Cyrus,

on

side 
from 
the 
royal 
line 
of 
Persia, 
is

as 
king

in 
Elam. 
He 
conquered 
Media, 549

appears 
as 
king 
of 
Media

Persia 
shortly 
after: 
conquered 
Croesus 
of 
Lydia 
by 540, 
and 
Babylon 538. 
Thus 
the 
MedoPersian 
Empire 
arose, 
succeeding 
to 
the 
dominating 
position 
formerly 
held 
by 
Assyria 
and

This 
seems 
right 
by 
the

as 
against 
of 
B, 
cf. 
xlii. 9. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
A'

probably 
wrong, 
as 
the

its

are 
used 
transitively.
The 
thought 
of

as 
Creator 
and 
Director, 
recurs. 
For 
the

it 
would 
seem 
that

read

The

is 
changed, 
and 
this 
appears 
to 
correspond 
to 
‘him

formed 
him,’ 
or, 
as 
below, 
‘the

κεραμέως 
to 
‘a

with

the 
second 
word 
being 
of 
the

instead 
of 
the

which 
LXX., 
dealing 
with 
a

were 
free 
to 
do.

The

not 
warranted

the

must 
have 
been 
introduced, 
as 
frequently

in 
the

of 
the

unthinkingly:

with

ἐντείλασθέ

This 
agrees 
with 
the 
wording 
of 
Heb., 
as 
it 
appears 
on 
the 
surface. 
But 
what 
is 
the 
drift? 
Kay 
makes 
this 
second 
clause 
depend 
on 
the 
ﬁrst: 
‘Ask 
me...
concerning 
my 
sons, 
and 
(when 
ye 
know) 
command 
me, 
&amp;
c.’ 
Delitzsch, 
and 
others, 
interpret 
me’ 
as=‘

my 
charge

&amp;
c.’: 
cf. 1 
Sam.

xvii. 23, 
ἃς. 
Prof. 
Davidson, 
in 
the 
brief 
note 
on 
this 
passage 
in 
the 
T 
ample 
Bible, 
put 
a 
stop 
after 
‘things 
to 
come’; 
continuing, 
my 
children...
command 
ye 
me,’ 
giving 
it 
the 
same 
sense 
Delitzsch. 
This 
however 
leaves 
a 
sense 
of 
something 
not 
quite 
like 
Hebrew: 
and 
Prof. 
Cheyne 
has 
pointed 
out 
that 
the 
sense 
given 
to 
the 
Heb. 
‘command,’ 
is 
not 
exactly 
parallel 
to 
the 
instances 
given. 
He 
would 
read 
imperfect 
for 
the 
imperative 
‘Ask,’ 
and 
render 
‘Will 
ye 
question 
me...? 
will 
ye 
lay 
commands 
upon 
me...?’ 
The 
same 
might 
be 
obtained 
by 
regarding 
the 
imperative 
as 
ironic: 
in 
which 
case 
there 
is 
perhaps 
a 
slight 
resemblance 
to 
Exod.

a 
word 
meaning 
‘that

in 
the

it 
is 
different, 
and 
mm. 
omit

Vulg., 
like 
A.

makes 
no 
distinction: 
formula: 
in

ac

στενάξατε] 
The 
Heb. 
word, 
which 
is 
obscure, 
is 
which 
some 
have 
connected 
with 
Ish, 
‘man’; 
‘show 
yourselves 
men,’ 
Others 
assign 
it 
to 
a 
root 
meaning 
‘be 
ﬁrm’ 
(so 
Delitzsch, 
R.
V. 
marg.). 
Vulg. 
has 
confundamini 
or 
fundamini. 
Lowth 
interpreted 
confundamini 
as 
‘take 
shame 
to 
yourselves,’=
cf. 
Gen. 
ii. 25 
Lagarde 
proposed 
to 
emend 
Heb. 
here 
accordingly. 
Others 
have 
suggested 
‘understand,’ 
‘consider,’ 
as 
in 
xliii. 18. 
It 
seems, 
however, 
from 
’s 
commentary, 
that 
either 
fundamini 
should 
be 
read, 
or 
the 
compound 
taken 
in 
that 
sense. 
What 
LXX. 
read 
is 
not 
clear. 
As 
Heb. 
does 
not 
occur 
elsewhere, 
στενάξατε 
may 
be 
a 
guess: 
‘fall 
to 
mourning,’ 
has 
been 
suggested 
by 
Lowth: 
also 
Possibly, 
LXX. 
read 
(Zeph. 
ii. 
I, 
and 
see 
note 
on 
xxxiii. 4), 
taking 
the 
sense 
as 
resembling 
viii. 9. 
In 
that 
case 
the 
original 
LXX. 
would 
have 
been 
συνάχθητε, 
which 
would 
have 
been 
corrupted 
to 
στενάχθητε, 
and 
then 
altered 
to 
the 
middle. 
But 
no 
certainty 
seems 
attainable.
μετανοήσατε] 
Scholz 
marks 
this 
as 
not 
in 
Heb.: 
LXX. 
has 
certainly 
a 
verb 
more 
than 
Heb., 
and 
ἐπιστρέψατε 
would 
naturally 
represent 
The 
order, 
however, 
would 
lead 
us 
to 
expect 
a 
verb 
where 
μετανοήσατε 
stands: 
and 
it 
seems 
to 
be 
an 
explanatory 
rendering 
of

the 
sense 
of 
‘turn’; 
ἐπιστρέψατε 
being 
also 
inserted, 
to 
suit

it 
is 
not 
clear 
what.
Πᾶσα] 
Not 
in 
Heb.
βεβούλευμαι] 
Heb. 
is 
not 
cognate 
with 
the

rendered 
βουλή. 
Either 
the 
writers 
of 
MSS., 
or 
the

seem 
to 
have 
been 
careless 
in 
distinguishing 
certain

of 
βουλεύω 
and 
βούλομαιι 
see

in

in 
some

Seneca, 
Apocolocyntosis, 
In. § 2, 
has 
a 
hit 
at 
the 
monthly 
prognosticators: 
“patere 
mathematicos 
aliquando 
verum 
dicere, 
qui 
illum, 
ex 
quo 
princeps 
factus 
est, 
omnibus 
annis, 
omnibus 
mensibus 
efferunt.” 
Tacitus 
has 
many 
references 
to 
them, 
not 
always 
without 
some 
appearance 
of 
credulity: 
Suetonius 
and 
Juvenal 
bear 
witness 
to 
the 
importance 
attached 
to 
them 
under 
many 
emperors, 
from 
Tiberius, 
“cum 
grege 
Chaldaeo” 
(Juv. 
Χ. 94), 
onwards. 
See 
also 
Apolog. 
xxxv.: 
“quas

ab 
angelis 
desertoribus 
proditas 
eta

interdictas 
ne 
suis

caussis

the 
references

it 
difficult

A.
V., 
Luther, 
and 
Vulgate 
(et 
spiritus

are 
decisively 
on 
the 
side 
of 
the 
former. 
Lxx., 
as 
usual, 
keep 
the 
Heb. 
order: 
but 
as 
Kay 
says, 
“It 
has 
been 
generally 
assumed, 
on 
the 
authority 
of 
Origen. 
that 
the 
rendering 
of 
the 
LXX. 
is 
ambiguous. 
But 
even 
his 
great 
name 
is 
not 
sufficient 
to 
persuade 
one 
that...
the 
enclitic 
με 
can 
be 
readily 
coordinated 
with 
the 
following 
noun.” 
asserts 
similarly 
that 
the 
suffixpronoun 
in 
the 
Heb. 
cannot 
be 
so 
coordinated, 
and 
claims 
the 
support 
of 
Heb. 
accents, 
and 
of 
the 
Targum, 
which 
latter 
Cheyne 
considers 
probable 
but 
not 
certain. 
Lowth 
quotes 
Origen 
(adv. 
σεῖε. 
I.) 
and 
translates 
with 
intentional 
ambiguity. 
Calvin, 
Vitringa, 
Henderson, 
Alexander, 
Knobel, 
Gesenius, 
Hitzig, 
Ewald, 
Delitzsch, 
Cheyne 
(doubtfully, 
and 
he 
appears 
to 
suspect 
the 
passage), 
Davidson 
(note 
in 
Temple 
Bible), 
Skinner, 
and 
W. 
E. 
Barnes 
all 
take 
the 
Heb. 
as 
‘hath 
sent 
me 
and 
His 
Spirit 
(obj). 
Prof. 
Driver 
seems, 
with 
some 
hesitation, 
to 
favour 
the 
opposite 
view: 
see 
his 
note 
in 
Isaiah, 
‘Men 
of 
the 
Bible’ 
Series, 
p. 
It 
should 
be 
noted, 
that 
those 
who 
make 
‘Spirit’ 
the 
subject, 
rely 
mainly 
on 
the 
ordinary 
grammar, 
and 
usual 
arrangement 
of 
sentence 
(Delitzsch 
instances 
only 
xxix. 7 
as 
a 
parallel, 
and 
Kay 
denies 
it); 
those 
who 
make 
it 
the 
object, 
do 
so 
on 
theological 
grounds, 
that 
the 
Spirit 
must 
be 
the 
sent, 
not 
the 
sender 
(instancing 1 
Kings 
xxii. 21, 22 
and 
chap. 
xliv. 3, 
lxi. 1, 
lxiii. 10, 11). 
This 
view, 
however, 
has 
difficulties 
of 
its 
own: 
lxi. 1. 
is 
not 
very 
clear 
in 
its 
influence: 
the 
accounts 
of 
the  
 Temptation, 
Matt. 
iv. 1, 
ὁ 
Ἰησοῦς 
ἀνήχθη 
ὑπὸ 
τοῦ 
πνεύματος, 
Mark 
i. 12 
τὸ 
πνεῦμα 
αὑτὸν

should 
be 
noted. 
If 
Acts 
xiii. 2, 
xvi. 7, 
may 
not 
be 
unreservedly 
quoted, 
there 
is 
also 
Judg. 
xiii. 
The 
list 
of 
authorities 
against 
making 
‘Spirit’ 
the 
subject 
is 
certainly 
an 
exceedingly 
strong 
one: 
yet 
the 
rules 
of 
language 
seem 
thoroughly 
in 
favour 
of 
it, 
and 
the 
theological 
arguments 
not 
such 
as 
to 
warrant 
the 
forsaking 
of 
the 
“literal 
and 
grammatical 
sense.’
τοῦ 
εύρεῖν 
σε

ὁδὸν] 
εὑρεῖν 
seems 
to 
have 
been 
chosen 
as 
a 
verb 
to 
suit 
ὁδὸν, 
Lxx. 
omitting 
‘to 
profit,’ 
and 
perhaps 
rendering 
the 
cognate 
(but 
causal) 
verb 
to 
‘path’ = 
‘make 
to 
tread,’ 
‘lead.’ 
It 
however 
possible 
that 
Lxx. 
omitted 
this 
cognate, 
the 
eye 
of 
the 
translator 
straying 
at 
this 
point 
from 
‘to 
profit,’ 
to 
the 
third 
word 
of 
ver. 18, 
which 
might 
fall 
just 
below: 
and 
reading 
that 
as 
Delitzsch 
considered 
that 
with 
καὶ

Κύριοι· 
κ.
τ.
λ., 
ver. 16, 
begins 
a 
kind 
of 
prelude

and 
what 
follows. 
This, 
according 
to 
Prof. 
Skinner, 
“it 
cannot 
possibly 
be”: 
and 
the 
end 
of 
xlviii. 
has 
been 
thought 
to 
mark 
a 
division 
of 
the 
whole 
prophecy. 
Yet 
in 
these 
verses 
we 
do 
seem 
to 
be 
looking 
both 
back 
and 
forward, 
esp. 
at

ὁ 
πόνος] 
This 
is. 
the 
rootmeaning 
of 
the 
Heb. 
word; 
but 
the 
modern 
view 
is 
to 
give 
it 
the 
secondary 
sense 
of 
‘recompense,’ 
‘wages.’ 
Cf.

Συναχ 
θήσομαι] 
Heb. 
has 
verb 
in 
3rd 
person, 
and 
the 
negative, 
which 
however 
the 
margin 
directs 
to 
be 
read 
‘to 
him’ 
for 
 as 
in 
ix. 3, 
lxiii. 9 
(the 
converse 
in 
xxxi. 8): 
the 
secondary 
authorities 
are 
divided; 
Vulg. 
has 
the 
negative, 
non 
congregabitur, 
so 
have 
Symm. 
and 
Theod.; 
but 
Aq. 
has 
none, 
nor 
Lxx. 
The 
majority, 
perhaps, 
of 
modems 
support 
the 
margin. 
Scholz'
s 
note 
(non 
congregabitur): 
Συναχθήσομαι. 
Das 
in 
ist 
Wiederholung 
des 
letzten 
Buchstabens 
von 
‘Israel’.” 
Similarly, 
if 
the 
N 
were 
regarded 
as 
Ist 
pers. 
prefix 
only 
is 
left 
unaccounted 
for 
in 
the 
Lxx. 
reading, 
which 
is 
thus 
explained. 
But 
apparently 
Dr 
Scholz 
considers 
the 
Lxx. 
preferable, 
which 
is 
a 
very 
different 
matter.
It 
should 
be 
observed 
that 
some 
Luc. 
Mss., 51 62 90 144 147 233 ’ 308, 
read 
συναχθήσεται, 
and 
Q* 
reads 
συναχθήσονται, 
a 
singular 
reading 
on 
its 
part 
which 
might 
have 
been 
deserving 
of 
more 
attention, 
were 
it 
not 
that 
δοξασθήσονται 
follows. 
The 
ﬁrst 
verb, 
however, 
may 
be 
rightly 
3rd 
pers. 
sing. 
or 
plural, 
and 
the 
two 
verbs 
may 
have 
been 
wrongly 
assimilated 
to 
Ist 
pers. 
in 
the 
usual 
text, 
and 
to 
3rd 
pers. 
plur. 
in 
Q* 
the 
order 
of 
words 
tending 
to 
bring 
this 
about.
The 
question 
as 
to 
the 
negative 
in 
Heb., 
and 
the 
construing 
of 
it, 
remains. 
Kay, 
supporting 
the 
negative, 
argues 
vigorously, 
here 
as 
on 
ix. 3, 
that 
there 
was 
strong 
reason 
against 
its 
establishing 
itself 
in 
the  
 text, 
unless 
it 
had 
been 
the 
true 
reading. 
This, 
however, 
seems 
scarcely 
valid 
if 
we 
suppose 
it 
to 
have 
been 
an 
error 
in 
the 
first 
place, 
rigidly 
perpetuated 
by 
scribes 
in 
the 
text, 
but 
corrected 
by 
the 
tradition, 
embodied 
in 
the 
margin. 
Further, 
the 
antithesis 
of 
facob 
brought 
again, 
and 
Israel 
not 
gathered, 
is 
unheard 
of 
elsewhere: 
not 
even 
judalz 
is 
so 
pointedly 
saved 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
Israel. 
To 
keep 
the 
negative, 
we 
seem 
bound 
to 
take 
note 
in 
another 
sense, 
that 
of 
‘carried 
off,’ 
‘taken 
away’ 
as 
in 
lvii. 1; 
which 
Prof. 
compares 
Ezek. 
xxxiv. 29, 
and 
Prof. 
Davidson 
(Temple 
Bible) 
adopt. 
Otherwise 
we 
must 
read 
and 
render, 
‘and 
that 
Israel 
be 
gathered 
unto 
him.
Μάγα] 
Scholz

an 
amplification, 
probably 
helped 
by 
the

Heb.

a 
difficult

many 
wish

in

The 
Syriac

the

that

exactly 
what

The

simple,

tempting; 
yet 
it 
is 
not 
certain

that 
the

This

it 
seem 
to

Heb. 
has 
here 
infin. 
of 
a 
verb 
‘to

(xl. 
Gen.

which 
differs 
only 
in 
its 
ﬁnal 
guttural 
from 
that

ὥς 
σευτλίον 
ἡμίεφθον] 
This 
discrepancy 
with 
the 
Heb. 
is 
well 
known 
and 
of 
old 
date. 
Heb. 
is 
usually 
taken 
to 
mean, 
‘like 
an 
antelope 
in 
a 
net’: 
assuming 
that 
here 
is 
the 
same 
as 
in 
Deut. 
xiv. 5 
to 
which 
there 
is 
general 
agreement 
in 
default 
of 
any 
better 
hypothesis. 
‘An 
antelope 
of 
a 
net’ 
is 
perhaps 
somewhat 
obscure 
for 
‘caught 
in 
net’: 
but 
not 
more 
so, 
perhaps, 
than 
‘a 
rainstorm 
of 
a 
wall,’ 
xxv. 
has 
’cut 
my: 
’lluqueatus, 
and 
Aq. 
Theod. 
Symm. 
translate 
similarly.
Jerome 
remarks 
on 
the 
passage: 
“Pro 
beta 
semicocta 
reliqui 
interpretes 
orygem 
captum 
et 
’llagueatum 
transtulerunt; 
qui 
Hebraice 
dicitur 
Tho . . . 
pro 
quo 
lxx. 
Syra 
lingua 
opinati 
sunt 
Thoreth 
quae 
dicitur 
beta.’
Prof. 
F. 
C. 
Burkitt 
suggests 
that 
for 
Thoreth, 
which 
does 
not 
mean 
‘beet’ 
in 
Syriac 
or 
any 
known 
language, 
we 
should 
read 
Thomech 
(a 
bitter 
herb 
used 
at 
the 
Passover): 
and 
that 
Jerome 
meant 
that 
the 
translator, 
having 
the 
text 
woman: 
before 
him, 
thought 
of 
this, 
and 
of 
‘bitter.’ 
The 
ingenuity 
of 
this 
guess 
is 
manifest: 
and 
it 
gives 
support 
to 
the 
Hebrew 
text. 
There 
is 
however 
no 
clue 
to 
the 
real 
meaning 
of 
the 
Hebrew, 
more 
than 
that 
already 
gained 
from 
the 
other 
ancient 
versions: 
and 
the 
nor. 
rendering 
may 
not 
have 
been 
rightly 
accounted 
for 
by 
Jerome. 
σευτλίον 
is 
puzzling, 
maybe 
corrupt, 
and 
Dr 
Alexander 
suggested 
that 
it 
might 
be 
a 
corruption 
of 
some 
Egyptian 
word: 
ἡμίεφθον, 
compared 
with 
Aquila'
s 
ἠμφιβληστρευμένος 
and 
Symm.'
s 
ἐν 
ἀμφιβλήστρῳ, 
certainly 
raises 
suspicion, 
that 
it 
have 
been 
corrupted 
from 
some 
compound 
with 
ἠμφι-.
 (Cf. 
Ps. 
cxli. 10, 
and 
note 
there 
in 
Mozley'
s 
Psalter 
of 
Me 
Church.) 
But 
there 
is 
no 
safe 
material 
on 
which 
to 
build 
a 
conjecture.
οὐκ 
ἀπὸ 
οἴνου] 
Cf. 
xxix. 9 
(and 
Lxx. 
of 
xxviii. 
Lowth 
compares 
the 
phrase 
of 
Aeschylus, 
Eumenides 860, 
Ἀοίνοις 
ἐμμανεῖς 
θυμώμασιν.
τῶν 
ταπεινωσάντων] 
AQ 
profix 
καί. 
The 
phrase 
is 
not 
in 
Heb., 
and 
perhaps 
duplicates 
τῶν 
ἀδικησάντων.
For 
ἐμβαλῶ 
(AQ) 
B 
has 
δώσω; 
cf. 
ἐμβαλῶ 
in 
xxxvii. 29, 
θήσω 
in 
the 
corresponding 
verse 
of 2 
Kings.
τὰ 
μετάφρενά 
σου] 
This 
looks 
like 
an 
explanation, 
which 
has 
turned 
out 
τὰ 
μέσα, 
read 
by 
B, 
which 
renders 
the 
Heb. 
literally.
ἔξω] 
rm, 
‘open 
place’ 
or 
‘street,’ 
means 
‘without,’ 
‘abroad,’ 
accompanied 
by 
certain 
prepositions. 
lxx. 
may 
have 
read 
before 
it 
as 
or 
(Cf. 
xlii. 
LII. 1. 
τὴν 
δόξαν 
σου] 
Heb. 
is 
almost 
more 
‘beauty’ 
than 
‘glory.’ 
Cf. 
Exod. 
xxviii. 2, 
where 
δόξα 
is 
used, 
as 
here. 
lxx. 
omits 
‘garments 
of.’
ἔκδυσαι] 
So 
RA 
and 
several 
cursives; 
Q* 
has 
ἔνδυσαι, 
the 
Luc. 
Mss. 
ἔκλυσον, 
and 
B 109 305 
(with 
Q 
mg) 
ἔκλυσαι. 
This 
last 
seems 
preferable, 
translating 
Heb. 
more 
closely, 
and 
accounting 
for 
the 
other 
readings, 
Δ 
and 
Λ 
being 
easily 
confused, 
and 
ἔνδυσαι 
having 
occurred 
twice 
in 
the 
previous 
verse. 
‘Loose 
from 
thee’ 
is 
the 
Heb. 
reading, 
which 
seems 
to 
have 
been 
generally 
followed: 
so 
Aq. 
Symm. 
Theod. 
and 
Vulg. 
solve 
vincula. 
The 
Heb. 
text 
has 
‘(the 
bands) 
are 
loosed.
ἐπρόθητε] 
Heb. 
is 
better 
rendered 
as 
passive 
than 
as 
reflexive 
cf. 
l. 1. 
δωρεὰν 
is 3 
felicitous 
rendering.
βία 
ἤχθησαν] 
The 
termination, 
3rd 
pers. 
sing. 
as 
object, 
has 
been 
read 
as 
3rd 
pers. 
plur. 
personal 
suffix, 
and 
the 
verb 
taken 
as 
passive. 
Even 
so, 
ἤχθησαν 
is 
not 
an 
exact 
translation, 
the 
Heb. 
meaning 
not 
‘led 
(captive)’ 
but 
‘oppressed.’ 
Βίᾳ 
seems 
to 
convey 
idea 
of 
irresponsible 
tyranny: 
the 
Heb. 
expression 
when 
followed 
by 
a 
noun 
means 
simply 
‘without,’ 
literally, 
‘in 
nothingness.’ 
the 
use 
of 
βία = 
‘in 
spite 
of,’ 
as 
Thucyd. 1. 43, 
ξυμμάχους 
δέχεσθε 
ἡμῶν; 
and 
with 
the 
whole 
phrase, 
Aesch. 
Persae 771, 
Ἰωνίαν 
τε 
πᾶσαν 
ἤλασεν 
βίᾳ.
τί 
ὅδε 
ἐστι] 
Α 
and 
seven 
cursives 
read 
ἔσται, 
but 
and 
pers. 
plur. 
is 
probably 
intended. 
τάδε 
following 
is 
not 
in 
Heb., 
in 
either 
place 
in 
the 
verse, 
but 
is 
supplied, 
as 
in 
iii. 16, 
v. 9 
ταῦτα), 
xiv. 24,, 
xvii. 4, 6, 
&amp;
c.
θαυμάζετε] 
Perhaps 
‘wonder 
ye’ 
for 
though 
the 
seems 
hardly 
to 
be 
intended 
as 
an 
imperat. 
in 
the 
Greek.
όλολύζετε] 
It 
is 
generally 
agreed 
that 
the 
Heb. 
verb 
is 
not 
causal 
(3rd 
pers. 
plur. 
indic. 
and 
2nd 
pers. 
plur. 
imperat. 
are 
alike 
in 
consonants). 
The 
Heb. 
word 
is 
not 
generally 
used 
of 
joy: 
nor 
is 
it 
necessarily 
so 
here, 
but 
of 
loud 
noise. 
lxx. 
insert 
δι’ 
ὑμᾶς 
and 
ἐν 
τοῖς 
ἔθνεσιν, 
perhaps 
following 
out 
an 
independent 
idea 
of 
the 
meaning.
πάρειμι] 
The 
Heb. 
phrase, 
a 
very 
common 
one, 
is 
exactly 
Me 
voici.
ὅρα] 
No 
doubt 
expresses 
‘beauty,’ 
esp. 
that 
of 
early 
prime, 
as 
in 
the 
spring, 
&amp;
c. 
This 
meaning 
comes 
out 
particularly 
in 
adjective. 
It 
has 
indeed 
been 
suggested 
that 
ver. 6 
should 
be 
brought 
to 
a 
full 
stop, 
as 
in 
Heb., 
after 
πάρειμι, 
and 
ver. 7 
read 
ὡς 
ὡραῖοι 
ἐπὶ 
τῶν 
ὀρέων 
οἱ 
πόδες 
κ.
τ.
λ. 
The 
syntax 
however 
is 
in 
any 
case 
different 
from 
Heb., 
and 
the 
text 
not 
of 
a 
kind 
without 
parallel 
in 
lxx.
Cf. 
with 
this 
verse 
Nah. 
i. 
ὀφθ. 
πρὸς 
ὀφθαλμοὺς] 
Apparently 
ὀφθαλμοὶ 
is 
intended 
to 
be 
the 
subject 
of 
ὄψονται, 
but 
it 
is 
not 
so 
in 
Heb. 
In 
Numb. 
xiv. 14 
B 
reads 
ὀφθαλμοῖς 
κατ’ 
ὀφθαλμούς. 
With 
the 
force 
of 
the 
expression  
 compare 1 
Cor. 
xiii. 12, 
Rev. 
xxii. 4. 
The 
modern 
sense 
of 
mutual 
understanding 
must 
not 
be 
read 
into 
the 
English 
of 
A.
V. 
It 
is 
an 
analogous 
phrase, 
in 
higher 
sense, 
to 
that 
used 
plainly 
and 
literally 
in 
Jerem. 
xxxii. 
ἐλεήσῃ] 
The 
Heb., 
if 
causal, 
which 
more 
probably 
it 
is 
not, 
is 
to 
‘bring 
back,’ 
and 
so 
occasionally 
to 
‘refresh’ 
or 
‘restore,’ 
when 
by 
‘the 
soul’ 
as 
obj. 
Ps. 
xxiii. 3, 
and 
probably 
xix. 7: 
Prov. 
xxv. 
c. 
lxx. 
generally 
renders 
by 
ἐπιστρέφω, 
except 
in 
Prov. 
l.
c. 
ὠφελεῖ). 
Here 
they 
paraphrase 
in 
familiar 
language.
Cf. 
Ps. 
xcviii. 1, 2, 
ἀφορίσθητε] 
Heb. 
‘purify 
yourselves’: 
the 
word 
has 
the 
force 
of 
setting 
apart: 
as 
in 
Ezek. 
xx. 38 
ἐλέγξω 
ἐξ 
ὑμῶν 
τοὺς 
ἀσεβεῖς, 
Eccl. 
iii. 18

The 
passage 
is 
quoted, 2 
Cor. 
vi. 17, 
in 
a 
compound 
quotation, 
with 
Ezek. 
xx. 34, 
Jerem. 
Ii. 45 
and 
possibly 
a 
reference 
to 
Numb. 
xvi. 
φέροντες 
τὰ 
σκεύη] 
The 
Heb. 
phrase 
is 
the 
regular 
one 
for 
‘armourbearer’ (1 
Sam. 
xiv. 1, 
c.), 
but 
might 
also 
have 
this 
meaning, 
as 
Numb. 
iv. 15 
shows: 
and 
the 
plural 
is 
perhaps 
in 
its 
favour, 
unless 
both 
meanings 
are 
combined.
ἐπισυνάγων] 
ἐπι-
 gives 
the 
required 
sense 
of 
closing 
the 
rear 
of 
a 
march: 
in 
Numb. 
x. 25 
the 
same 
word 
is 
rendered 
by 
ἔσχατοι. 
Cf. 
Exod. 
xiv. 19, 
Josh. 
vi. 9. 
Also 
lviii. 
συνήσει] 
Literal, 
but 
the 
Heb. 
verb 
often 
indicates 
action 
as 
well 
as 
wisdom: 
as, 
perhaps, 1 
Sam. 
xviii. 30, 
cf. 
ver. 5, 14 
of 
the 
same 
chapter.
lxx. 
omit 
one 
of 
the 
four 
Heb. 
verbs: 
by 
general 
agreement, 
the 
last: 
supplied 
only 
as 
a 
Hexaplaric 
addition.
LXX. 
use 
2nd 
person 
in 
the 
parenthetic 
clause, 
whereas 
Heb. 
has 
3rd: 
but 
the 
changes 
of 
person 
in 
prophecy 
are 
often 
perplexing: 
see, 
for 
instance, 
i. 
θαυμάσονται] 
The 
Heb. 
is 
obscure: 
some 
render 
it, 
‘he 
shall 
astonish,’ 
or, 
‘startle 
many 
nations’: 
of 
which 
Lxx. 
might 
seem 
an 
inversion. 
It 
was 
formerly 
generally 
taken 
to 
mean, 
‘he 
shall 
sprinkle’; 
so 
A.
V., 
Vulg. 
asperget, 
Aq. 
and 
Theod. 
ῥαντίσει: 
Kay 
Pusey 
support 
this, 
but 
it 
is 
objected 
that 
the 
verb 
means, 
not 
to 
sprinkle 
a 
person 
with 
a 
liquid, 
but 
to 
scatter 
as 
the 
liquid 
itself. 
It 
is, 
however, 
going 
rather 
far 
to 
pronounce 
that 
the 
sense 
cannot 
be 
transferred, 
as 
it 
evidently 
is 
in 
some 
languages. 
Lowth, 
favouring 
an 
emendation,

Prof. 
Cheyne 
writes 
on 
the 
tenses 
of 
this 
passage: 
“We 
ought 
clearly 
to 
carry 
either 
the 
perf. 
or 
the 
future 
(the 
latter 
would 
express 
the 
ideality, 
the 
prophetic 
imaginativeness 
of 
the 
point 
of 
view) 
throughout 
ver. 
2—10a. 
The 
inconsistent 
future 
of 
A.
V., 
ver. 
comes 
from 
the 
Vulgate 
(though 
in 2 
b 
this 
version 
has 
the 
perf.). 
The 
not. 
mostly 
has 
aorists 
(pres. 
twice 
in 4, 
twice 
in 7, 
once 
in 10) 
Both 
um. 
and 
Vulg. 
strangely 
give 
the 
future 
in 
ver. 
παιδίον] 
Heb. 
a 
‘sapling,’ 
or 
‘sucker,’ 
the 
obvious 
meaning 
being 
that 
given 
by 
lxx., 
but 
the 
parallelism 
leads 
us 
to 
the 
former.
κάλλος] 
The 
Heb. 
word 
is 
from 
the 
same 
root 
as 
that 
in 
Haggai 
ii. 7, 
“the 
desirable 
thing: 
of 
all 
nations.”
LXX. 
insert 
ἀλλὰ

a 
more 
specific 
connection 
with

κ.
τ.
λ.] 
Cf. 
ἐν 
πληγῇ 
in 
the 
previous 
verse: 
Heb. 
has 
three 
participles, 
which 
might 
have 
been 
read, 
with 
slight 
change, 
as 
nouns 
but 
it 
seems 
to 
be 
a 
case 
of 
freedom 
in 
rendering.
The 
Heb. 
word 
corresponding 
to 
ἐν 
πόνῳ 
is 
used 
in 
Leviticus, 
and 
in 2 
Kings 
xv. 5, 
of 
leprosy: 
and 
so 
Vulg. 
Aq. 
and 
Symm. 
render 
it 
here, 
though 
there 
is 
no 
absolute 
necessity 
to 
make 
it 
specific.
μώλωπι] 
Cf. 
i. 
ἄνθρωπος] 
‘Each,’ 
Heb. 
risk, 
which 
in 
this 
sense 
is 
generally 
represented 
by 
ἅνθρωπος, 

and 
not 
ἀνήρ: 
see 
however 2 
Kings 
xviii. 31 
whereas 
Isai. 
xxxvi. 16 
has 
ἕκαστος, 
cf. 
variant 
in 
xiv. 18. 
Other 
instances 
are 
iii. 5, 
xiii. 14, 
xlvii. 15, 
with 
xxxi. 7 
Heb., 
but 
prob. 
not 
xxxii. 
παρέδωκεν 
αὐτὸν 
ταῖς 
ἁμαρτίαις] 
In 
Heb., 
‘sins’ 
is 
the 
direct 
obj., 
and 
the 
verb 
means 
‘caused 
to 
meet,’ 
or, 
‘to 
light 
on

has

εἷς 
αὐτόν. 
Vulg. 
Vulg.

LXX. 
omit 
‘all.’
κεκακῶσθαι] 
The 
corresponding 
word 
in 
Heb. 
is 
from 
same 
root 
as 
in 
ver. 4, 
LXX. 
omitting 
the 
previous 
word 
‘he 
was 
oppressed.’
This 
passage 
is 
quoted, 
Acts 
viii. 32, 33, 
as 
read 
by 
the 
Ethiopian 
eunuch. 
The 
quotation 
follows 
LXX., 
MSS. 
of 
the 
NT. 
varying 
between 
κείραντος 
and 
κείροντος, 
and 
inserting 
αὐτὸν 
with 
ℵca 
AQ 
and 
several 
cursives. 
(Clem. 
Rom. 
omits 
αὐτόν: 
Cypr. 
Testim. 11. 15, 
cf. 
Epist. 
VI., 
appears 
to 
read 
coram 
tondente 
se.) 
This 
differs 
considerably 
from 
Heb., 
which 
is 
difficult: 
some 
render 
‘From 
oppression 
and 
from 
judgment 
he 
was 
taken ’ 
i.
e. 
removed, 
released: 
others, 
‘Through 
oppression . . . 
he 
was 
taken 
away,’ 
i.
e. 10 
death, 
cut 
off. 
The 
Heb. 
preposition 
is 
κρίσις 
αὐτοῦ 
ἤρθη] 
Possibly, 
‘(by 
his 
humiliation) 
his 
sentence 
was 
done 
away ’:

τήν 
γενεὰν 
αὐτοῦ 
τίς 
διηγήσεται;] 
LXX. 
in 
a 
sense 
is 
near 
Heb., 
but 
the 
latter 
is 
again 
uncertain: 
the 
word 
‘generation’ 
perhaps 
meaning 
the 
period, 
and 
the 
men 
living 
in 
it, 
i.
e. 
contemporaries: 
so 
Gesenius, 
Cheyne, 
and 
Delitzsch, 
who 
says 
that 
the 
LXX. 
must 
mean 
‘Who 
can 
count 
his 
posterity? 
the 
Heb. 
being 
taken 
to 
mean 
‘and 
as 
to 
his 
generation, 
who 
considered 
that 
he 
was...?’ 
As 
to 
the 
sign 
of 
the 
accus. 
thus 
used, 
see 
Davidson, 
Syntax, § 78: 
but 
this 
passage 
is 
not 
instanced. 
Kay 
translates, 
‘And 
his 
life 
who 
will 
consider?’ 
a 
lifetime, 
that 
is, 
so 
short. 
Lowth, 
‘And 
his 
manner 
of 
life 
who 
would 
declare? 
referring 
to 
an 
alleged 
custom 
of 
inviting 
witnesses 
to 
character 
before 
condemnation 
on 
a 
capital 
charge, 
and 
pointing 
out 
the 
bearing 
of 
John 
xviii. 20, 21, 
and 
Acts 
xxvi. 4, 5. 
It 
is, 
however, 
denied 
by 
most  
 modern 
authorities 
that 
the 
Heb. 
word 
can 
mean 
‘course’ 
or 
‘manner’ 
of 
life, 
and 
’s 
explanation 
seems 
to 
have 
dropped 
out 
of 
consideration.
ἡ 
ζωὴ] 
Heb. 
‘of 
the 
living.
άπὸ 
τᾶν 
άνομιῶν] 
Heb. 
has 
again 
the 
prep. 
ἤχθη 
εἰς 
Θάνατον] 
Heb. 
‘a 
stroke 
(was) 
upon 
him’: 
the 
form 
regularly 
mean 
‘upon 
them,’ 
but 
many 
authorities 
consider 
it 
equivalent 
here 
to 
a 
singular: 
cf. 
xliv. 15, 
perhaps 
Ps. 
xi. 7 
Job 
xxii. 2, 
c 
For 
this 
pronoun, 
LXX. 
seem 
to 
have 
read 
‘to 
death’: 
some 
have 
approved 
this 
as 
an 
emendation 
of 
Heb.
καὶ 
δόσει] 
Heb. 
literally, 
‘And 
(one) 
gave 
his 
grave 
with 
wicked 
men, 
and 
with 
a 
rich 
man 
in 
his 
deaths.’ 
Some 
think 
‘rich’ 
must, 
by 
parallelism 
with 
‘wicked,’ 
be 
a 
term 
of 
evil 
meaning: 
cf. 
Prov. 
xi. 28; 
Delitzsch 
thinks 
it 
rather 
to 
be 
antithetic: 
which 
would 
seem 
to 
be 
a 
natural 
development 
of 
parallelism, 
but 
Prof. 
Skinner 
calls 
this 
view 
‘utterly 
unwarrantable.’ 
Partial 
antithesis 
no 
doubt 
rarer, 
but 
see, 
e.
g., 
Prov. 
xiii. 22. 
Some 
resort 
to 
emendation, 
Ewald 
reading 
‘oppressor,’ 
for 
‘rich’: 
LXX. 
however 
clearly 
support 
the 
Heb. 
text 
in 
the 
main. 
It 
is 
certainly 
tempting 
to 
read, 
altering 
the 
points, 
‘his 
high 
places,’ 
to 
mean, 
‘his 
tomb’; 
‘in 
his 
deaths’: 
not. 
do 
not 
give 
any 
colour 
to 
this, 
but 
the 
text 
would 
not 
give 
any 
clue.

τῆς

is 
for 
the 
verb, 
‘he

sickness

ἐὰν 
δῶτε] 
Syntax 
differs 
again 
from 
Heb., 
which 
is 
either 
‘if 
his 
soul 
should 
make 
a 
guiltoffering,’ 
or, 
‘if 
thou 
shouldst 
make 
his 
soul.’ 
To 
read 
‘if...’ 
or 
‘when 
he 
shall 
make...’ 
with 
Ewald 
and 
Cheyne, 
a 
letter 
must 
be 
altered.
ἀφελεῖν] 
The 
connection 
of 
the 
words 
differs 
from 
Heb. 
LXX. 
omit 
‘in 
his 
hand,’ 
and 
this 
inﬁn. 
corresponds 
to 
‘shall 
prosper.’ 
Whether 
as 
a 
paraphrase, 
or 
by 
reading 
ABBREV 
for 
ABBREV, 
the 
alteration 
of 
one 
letter 
to 
ὠφελεῖν 
would 
bring 
the 
Greek 
nearer 
to 
Heb. 
The 
construction 
and 
sense, 
however, 
would 
not, 
even 
with 
a 
change 
of 
punctuation, 
be 
improved 
thereby.
δεῖξαι] 
Represents 
‘shall 
see,’ 
taken 
as 
causal, 
φῶς 
being 
a 
supplement 
on 
the 
part 
of 
LXX.
πλάσαι] 
Heb. 
‘he 
shall 
be 
satisﬁed.’ 
Schleusner’
s 
conjecture 
that 
πλῆσαι 
is 
the 
original 
LXX. 
reading 
seems 
most 
probable.
I2. 
κληρονομήσει...
μεριεῖ] 
Heb. 
has 
the 
same 
verb 
in 
both 
clauses, 
but 
LXX. 
introduce 
a 
variety, 
perhaps 
being 
unable 
to 
dispense 
with 
it. 
It 
seems 
preferable 
to 
make 
κληρονομήσει 
causal, 
cf. 
xiv. 2, 
xlix. 8 
and 
not 
render 
‘shall 
inherit 
many,’ 
which 
gives, 
at 
the 
least, 
a 
difﬁcult 
sense.
παρεδόθη] 
May 
be 
taken 
the 
ﬁrst 
time 
as 
a 
paraphrase 
for 
‘he 
poured 
out,’ 
though 
inverted: 
the 
second 
time 
the 
Heb. 
is 
quite 
different, 
being 
the 
same 
as 
that 
rendered 
by 
παρέδωκεν 
in 
ver. 6, 
but 
it 
seems 
scarcely 
possible 
to 
connect 
the 
two 
verses 
in 
translating. 
The 
primary 
meaning 
seems 
to 
be 
that 
of 
meeting 
or 
(bringing 
into) 
contact, 
and 
many 
renderings 
occur 
in 
different 
passages 
of 
A.
V. 
See 
Albert 
Barnes 
on 
ver. 6, 
above. 
LXX. 
have 
probably 
guessed, 
falling 
back 
on 
their 
favourite 
word.
ἁμαρτίας 
πολλῶν 
ἀνήνεγκεν] 
Quoted, 
Heb. 
ix. 28: 
cf. 
ver. 
LIV. 1. 
Quoted, 
Gal. 
iv. 27, 
accurately 
from 
LXX., 
down 
to 
ἄνδρα. 
LXX. 
omit 
‘singing.’
τῶν 
αὐλαιῶν 
σου] 
LXX. 
omit 
‘of 
thy 
habitation’ 
(word 
used 
for 
the 
Tabernacle), 
which 
is 
also 
called 
a 
‘tent,’ 
see 
Exod. 
xxvii. 19 
(habitation) 
and 21 
(tent).
ἔτι...
ἐκπέτασον] 
Heb. 
‘for

If 
ἔτι 
were 
originally 
ὅτι, 
a 
future 
following 
might 
have 
been 
assimilated 
to 
the 
previous 
imperatives. 
Heb. 
has 
‘break 
forth,’ 
which 
is 
softened 
by 
LXX.
κατῃσχύνθης...
ὠνειδίσθης] 
LXX. 
taking 
these 
verbs 
in 
the 
past—  
 rather 
contrary 
to 
their 
practice, 
as 
Heb. 
has

thought 
necessary 
to 
omit 
the 
negatives.

Heb.

no

the 
ﬁrst 
time 
Lxx. 
may 
have 
read 
‘for,’ 
as 
but 
the 
second, 
at 
least, 
must 
be 
due 
to 
the 
translators' 
view 
of 
the 
meaning.
A* 
omits 
καὶ 
ὀλιγόψυχον, 
probably 
an 
inadvertence. 
The 
two 
words 
‘forsaken’ 
and 
‘grieved’ 
are 
closely 
alike 
in 
Heb., 
differing 
only 
by 
and 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
words.
έλεήσω] 
Heb. 
has 
‘I 
will 
gather’: 
which 
(though 
a 
paraphrase 
is 
possible) 
looks 
as 
though 
the 
right 
word 
had 
been 
lost 
in 
the 
Greek, 
by 
confusion 
with 
ver. 8; 
where

or 
‘outburst

wrath,’ 
word 
for 
‘outburst’ 
being 
unknown 
elsewhere, 
but 
supposed 
to 
be 
a 
variant 
of 
a 
word 
for 
‘torrent.’ 
It 
forms 
a 
strong 
rhyming 
assonance 
with 
the 
word 
for 
‘wrath.’

the 
idea

of

The 
present 
Heb. 
text 
begins 
‘For 
the 
waters 
(of 
Noah 
is 
this)....’ 
lxx.'
s 
reading 
is 
one 
word, 
and 
Vulg. 
sicut 
in

also 
one 
word. 
Theod.

Some 
few 
MRS, 
the 
Peshitta, 
and 
many 
editors, 
including 
Delitzsch, 
support 
this 
reading. 
Cf. 
Matt. 
xxiv. 37, 
ὥσπερ 
γὰρ 
αἱ 
ἡμέραι 
τοῦ

and 
Luke

but 
it 
can 
hardly 
be 
argued 
that 
the 
occurrence 
of 
so 
Simple 
a 
phrase 
in 
N.
T. 
gives 
anything 
approaching 
to 
evidence 
as 
to 
the 
present 
passage, 
in 
which, 
moreover, 
‘the 
waters 
of 
Noah 
follows 
in 
the 
next 
clause, 
this 
repetition 
being 
of 
a 
kind 
often 
brought 
forward 
as 
characteristic 
of 
Isai. 
xl.—
lxvi. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
omit 
this 
second 
reference 
to 
‘the 
waters 
of 
Noah’ 
altogether, 
clauses 
being 
apparently 
confused: 
which 
detracts 
from 
the 
value 
of 
their 
evidence 
very 
seriously: 
and 
ἐν 
τῷ

may 
have 
some 
reference 
to 
‘days.’
τοῦ

‘Which 
was 
in 
the 
time 
of

a 
familiar 
construction, 
the 
case 
after

being 
regularly 
genitive:

The 
confusion 
noted 
above 
is 
still 
in 
progress, 
‘I 
have 
sworn’ 
being 
omitted 
the 
second 
time: 
the

 and 
its 
apodosis 
being 
combined: 
τῇ 
γῇ

ἐπὶ

both 
come 
into 
relation 
with 
θυμωθήσεσθαι, 
Heb. 
having 
the 
prep. 
in 
both 
cases: 
but 
it 
seems 
necessary, 
in 
translating, 
to 
take 
ἐπὶ

in 
the 
sense 
of

The 
connection 
of

to 
differ, 
into 
ver. 
ὤμοσα] 
Supposing 
the 
limitations 
of 
Heb. 
to 
be 
positively 
known, 
‘sware’ 
may 
fairly 
be 
considered 
to 
describe 
God'
s 
making 
of 
a 
covenant, 
though 
no 
oath 
be 
mentioned 
explicitly 
in 
Genesis.
μεταστήσασθαι]

B

have 
μεταστήσεσθαι, 
which 
is 
easier 
in 
any 
case,

be 
taken 
intransitively, 
as 
the 
Heb.
εἶπεν

Κύριος 
Ἵλεώς

So 
ℵAQ 
and 
most 
cursives. 
B 
has 
Ἵλεώς 
σοι 
Κύριε, 
which 
is 
practically 
unsupported, 
and 
difficult. 
Cf. 
Matt. 
xvi. 22, 
and 
Gen. 
xliii. 23, 
where 
Heb. 
is 
‘Peace 
unto 
you.’ 
Κύριος 
ἐλεῶν 
σε 
would 
be 
nearer 
to 
the 
usual 
rendering 
of 
Heb.; 
but 
the 
Greek 
is 
too 
near 
to 
make 
it 
likely 
that 
there 
is 
corruption.
ἄνθρακα] 
Generally 
‘a 
hot 
coal,’ 
but, 
when 
speaking 
precious 
stones, 
believed 
to 
be 
the 
‘carbuncle,’ 
whose 
name 
has 
the 
same 
meaning. 
It 
more 
generally 
corresponds, 
as 
Prof. 
Skinner 
points 
out, 
to 
than 
to 
which 
Heb. 
has 
here, 
and 
whose 
meaning 
is 
‘antimony,’ 
used 
for 
painting 
round 
the 
eyes, 
and 
here 
for 
a 
setting 
for 
the 
stones.
Delitzsch'
s 
note 
supplies 
all 
that 
can 
well 
be 
said 
upon 
the 
symbolical 
heraldry 
of 
the 
passage. 
Cf. 
Tobit

ἀπέχου] 
Heb. 
verb 
is 
now 
generally 
taken 
as 
imperat.
προσήλυτοι] 
This 
seems 
to 
be 
used, 
almost 
as 
a 
participle 
of 
προσέρχομαι, 
to 
represent 
the 
emphatic 
or 
intensive 
repetition 
of 
the 
Heb. 
verb. 
The 
negative 
word 
is 
omitted, 
probably 
from 
wrong 
ideas 
as 
to 
the 
meaning. 
Heb. 
is 
doubtful: 
either 
(i) 
‘they

not 
from

or 
(ii) 
‘they

Inserted

converted 
into 
a

with 
negatives 
inserted 
against 
Heb.

Yet 
it 
can 
hardly 
be 
right, 
for 
B'
s 
reading 
σκευαστὸν 
is 
confirmed 
by 
the 
impossible

of ℵ*, 
which 
is 
accounted 
for 
by 
σκευας 
dropping 
out 
after 
σκεῦος; 
also 
it 
agrees 
with 
the 
meaning 
of 
Heb., 
and 
imitates, 
though 
with 
different 
words, 
the 
Heb. 
assonance 
in 
φθαρτὸν 
probably 
was 
due 
to 
φθεῖραι 
just 
before:

A'

insertion

to 
be 
an

the

The 
Heb. 
is 
said 
to 
be 
used 
here 
rather 
of 
the 
bearer 
of 
witness 
than 
the 
witness 
borne. 
But 
the 
distinction 
is 
not 
easy 
to 
maintain: 
cf. 
Horace, 
Odes 
IV. 
iv. 37, 
“Quid

ὤσπερ] 
Not 
in 
Heb.: 
the 
order 
of 
the 
expressions 
is 
made 
clearer, 
as 
the 
ordinary 
mode 
of 
distinguishing 
subject 
and 
predicate 
fails. 
The 
second 
clause 
is 
thus 
seen 
to 
differ 
from 
the 
Hebrew, 
which 
has 
a 
chiasmus. 
Even 
the 
comparative 
particle 
in 
ver. 9 
is 
omitted 
in 
Heb.: 
but 
this 
is 
not 
unusual 
in 
Heb., 
cf.

and 
see 
Delitzsch'

Heb. 
definitely

διανοήματα . . . 
διανοίας] 
The 
same 
Heb. 
word 
as 
βουλαὶ 
in

Here 
the 
difference 
introduced 
in 
the 
Greek 
may 
be 
between 
the 
isolated 
attempts 
of 
human 
intelligence, 
and 
the 
eternal, 
sustained 
thought 
of 
God.
ἕως

Heb.

construed:

perhaps 
rather, 
‘without

and 
so 
in 
ver.
ἐκτέκῃ . . . 
βλαστήσει] 
γῆ 
must 
be 
the

but 
the 
Heb.

causal.
σπέρμα . . .

Quoted, 2 
Cor.

κλάδοις 
somewhat 
impairs 
the 
effect 
of 
the

The

cannot 
be 
certainly 
identified. 
The 
Heb. 
word 
rendered 
‘thorn’ 
is 
found 
only 
here 
and 
vii. 19, 
that 
for 
‘brier’ 
here 
only. 
The 
‘ﬁr’ 
and 
‘myrtle’ 
occur, 
xli. 
Lowth 
quotes 
Virg. 
Ecl. 
v. 62 
foll., 
to 
illustrate 
ver. 12: 
“Ipsi 
laetitia 
voces 
ad 
sidera 
iactant
lntonsi 
montes: 
ipsae 
iam 
carmina 
rupes,
Ipsa

So 
in 
Heine'
s 
Der 
Fichtenbaum, 
the 
trees 
have 
their 
feelings, 
though 
not 
of 
joy: 
“Ein

Er 
traumt 
von 
einer 
Palme,
Die 
fern

Morgenland
Einsam 
und 
schweigend 
trauert
Auf

Felsenwand’
And 
both 
feelings 
are 
imagined 
in 
Tennyson'
s 
Maud, 
“O, 
art 
thou 
sighing 
for 
Lebanon,
Dark 
cedar, 
tho’ 
they 
limbs 
have 
here 
increased,
Upon 
a 
pastoral 
slope 
as 
fair,’
 and 
again, 
“The 
red 
rose 
cries, 
‘She 
is 
near, 
she 
is 
near’
And 
the 
white 
rose 
weeps, 
‘She 
is 
late’:
The 
larkspur 
listens, 
‘I 
hear, 
I 
hear’
And 
the 
lily 
whispers, 
‘I 
wait.”

‘lying

The 
former, 
closely 
‘seers,’

to 
have 
been 
read 
by 
Vulg. 
(videntes

Symmachus; 
also 
by

the

‘smooth,’ 
plur., 
being 
from 
the 
same 
root 
as 
for

perhaps 
a 
play 
on 
words 
in 
Heb. 
It 
has 
been 
doubted 
whether, 
as 
‘smooth’ 
may 
mean 
‘slippery,’ 
‘deceitful’ 
(as 
in 
Ezek. 
xii. 24), 
stones 
are 
really 
meant. 
But 
it

most

Their

Heb. 
‘thou

either 
taken 
as 
causal 
would 
need 
prefixed 
and 
the 
cognate 
verb 
to 
‘sacriﬁce’ 
omitted: 
or 
the 
general 
sense 
thus 
expressed.
ᾤου 
ὅτι 
ἐὰν] 
Heb. 
has 
merely 
‘for,’ 
and 
LXX. 
have 
endeavoured 
to 
supply 
a 
connection 
may 
also 
mean 
‘that,’ 
or 
‘if’). ℵ 
reads, 
for 
ᾤου, 
ὡς, 
which, 
if 
it 
can 
be 
translated, 
must 
mean, 
‘with 
the 
idea 
that 
if...’: 
but 
it 
is 
unsupported. 
ἀποστῇς 
rather 
strains 
meaning 
of 
‘to 
go 
away’ 
(into 
captivity), 
cf. 
xvi. 3, 
which 
probably 
not 
the 
sense 
here. 
Ezek. 
xvi. 25, 
c,. 
looks 
like 
amplification 
of 
this 
passage.
πλεῖόν 
τι 
ἕξεις] 
Heb. 
‘thou 
art 
gone 
up,’ 
from 
 probably 
as 
‘it 
profiteth,’ 
and 
paraphrased.
The 
next 
two 
clauses 
are 
omitted 
in 
the 
best 
MSS. 
of 
LXX.
καὶ 
ἐπλήθυνας 
τὴν 
πορνείαν 
σου 
μετ’ 
αὐτῶν] 
Heb. 
has 
‘thou 
hast 
travelled 
to 
the 
king 
with 
οil.’ 
There 
seems 
no 
connection 
between 
the 
(ireck 
and 
this. 
Some 
duplication 
suggests 
itself, 
or, 
more 
likely, 
that 
a 
missing 
clause 
of 
ver. 8 
is 
represented 
by 
these 
words.
Heb. 
refers 
either 
to 
sending 
presents 
to 
some 
sovereign: 
cf. 
Hosea, 
xii. 1, 
ἔλαιον 
εἰς 
Αἴγυπτον 
ἐνεπορεύετο, 
and 
xxx. 6; 
or 
to 
offerings 
to 
an 
idol, 
‘Molech’ 
being 
the 
same 
word 
as 
‘king’ 
with 
altered 
vowels. 
Delitzsch 
speaks 
strongly 
against 
this 
latter 
view.
τοὺς 
μικρὸν 
ἀπὸ 
σοῦ] 
Heb. 
‘perfumes,’ 
‘perfume’ 
being 
misread 
as 
pm 
‘be 
far 
off,’ 
which 
occurs 
later 
in 
the 
verse 
in 
form 
where 
ὑπὲρ 
τὰ 
ὅριά

may 
be 
an 
attempt 
at 
variety 
for 
a 
supposed 
parallelism, 
or 
rather 
repetition.
ἐταπανώθης] 
The 
causal 
form 
in 
Heb. 
has 
generally 
been 
taken 
here 
as 
though 
with 
‘thyself’ 
for 
object. 
Vulg. 
humiliata 
es.
ταῖς 
πολυοδίαις] 
Heb. 
would 
naturally 
mean 
‘much 
journeying,’ 
or, 
‘length 
of

as 
in 
Josh. 
ix. 
ἐκοπίασας] 
Α

itself 
(no 
partic. 
of

Or 
σε 
ἰδὼν 
may 
be 
a 
corruption 
of 
σειγων, 
i.
e. 
σιγῶν.
παρορῶ] 
Pointing 
the 
Heb. 
word 
‘from 
of 
old’ 
as 
a 
participle, 
with 
inserted, 
‘turning 
away’ 
(the 
eyes?). 
The 
Greek 
verb 
has 
same 
ambiguity 
as 
‘overlook’ 
in 
English, 
but 
generally 
means 
not 
to 
see. 
So 
Vulg. 
quasi 
non

κακὰ] 
interpreting 
Heb. 
‘thy

The 
‘righteousness’

spurious.

καταιγὶς] 
Parallelism

led 
LXX. 
to 
put 
a 
word

violence

than 
of 
slightness

could 
they 
have 
read 
Heb. 
‘a

Καθαρίσατε] 
Heb. 
‘cast

Perhaps 
(cf. 
Ps

LXX. 
(That 
they 
could 
have 
connected 
it 
with

taken 
it 
of

as 
in 
lxii. 10,

less 
likely.)
ἀπὸ

Taking

‘face’ 
(same 
root), 
which 
would 
usually 
have 
some 
preceding

The 
second 
may 
have 
been 
misread.
Ἅγιος 
ἐν

simply 
‘holy,’

the 
phrases 
in 
the 
context 
may 
account

s 
amplifying. 
Many 
think 
that 
‘Holy’ 
rightly 
a 
title, 
not 
an 
attribute 
of 
‘name.
The 
rest 
of 
the 
verse 
is 
somewhat 
changed. 
διδοὺς 
ζωὴν 
corresponds 
to 
the 
second 
‘to ’ 
of 
Heb. 
If 
διδοὺς 
be 
taken 
then 
as 
corresponding 
to 
the 
ﬁrst 
‘revive,’ 
ὀλιγοψύχοις 
represents 
‘crushed 
and 
humble 
in 
spirit,’ 
μακροθυμίαν 
‘the 
spirit 
of 
the 
humble,’ 
and 
καρδίαν 
συντετριμμένοις 
‘the 
heart 
of 
the 
crushed 
ones.’ 
Lxx. 
are 
apt 
to 
lose 
exactness 
when 
dealing 
with 
passages 
in 
which 
the 
same 
words 
recur, 
as 
here.
ἐκδικήσω] 
Rather 
‘punish,’ 
than 
as 
Heb. 
‘contend.’ 
Vulg. 
litigabo.
πνοὴν 
πᾶσαν 
ἐγὼ 
ἐποίησα] 
πᾶσαν 
is 
not 
in 
Heb., 
which 
has 
plur., 
not 
found 
elsewhere, 
and 
does 
not 
express 
the 
relative. 
Vulg. 
flatus 
ego 
faciam.
βραχύ 
τι] 
Reading 
‘of

without 
ﬁnal

meaning 
‘a

to 
Lowth: 
but 
of

the 
Lxx.

be 
the 
only 
confirmation.

also

Practically 
identical 
with 
xlviii. 22. 
Heb. 
has 
‘my 
God’  
 instead 
of 
‘the 
Lord.’ 
Some 
think 
the

is 
a 
refrain,

of

diff. 
word, 
Aq. 
probably 
dative. 
Cyprian 
has 
tuba 
twice, 
Lucifer 
perhaps 
tubae. 
The 
evidence 
for 
accus. 
is 
practically 
Hesychian, 
and 
it 
may 
be 
an 
attempt 
to 
touch 
up 
the 
Creek: 
the 
dative 
seems 
best 
attested 
as 
the 
original 
and 
harder 
reading.

So 
Α 41 87 97 106 147 308 309:

the 
following

Cypr. 
Testim. 
m. 1 
has 
quaerunt...
concupiscunt, 
but 
the 
Latin 
evidence 
is 
less 
decisive 
on 
such 
a 
point. 
Heb.

the

perhaps 
the 
original 
mm. 
for

The

it 
seems

do 
not 
apparently

but 
treat 
the

imperatives; 
a 
construction 
not 
uncommon 
in 
Heb., 
and 
sometimes 
found 
in 
Greek,  
 the

simply 
suggesting 
the

is 
perhaps 
the 
original

of

sometimes 
ambiguous,

on

the

continues 
with

Opinions 
differ, 
but 
the 
most 
usual 
explanation 
is 
that

of 
Romans. 
(From 
Lxx. 
it 
passed

the 
next.

Heb. 
is 
here 
‘uprightness,’

probably 
represent 
a 
slightly 
different 
text.

the

not

be 
a 
loose 
attempt 
at 
a 
rendering. (

seems 
to 
contain 
the

out

and

to,

shortened

supplying 
the 
last 
clause 
from 
Theod. 
Symm. 
The 
word 5101 
rendered 
‘deeds’ 
and 
‘recompense,’ 
is 
a 
word 
of 
correlative 
meaning, 
implying 
a 
deed, 
good 
or 
bad, 
and 
its 
return, 
in 
reference 
to 
each 
other. 
ὄνειδος 
hardly 
represents 
any 
term 
of 
the 
Heb. 
with 
exactness.
ἤξει. . . 
βίαιος] 
Heb. 
is 
difficult, 
and 
generally 
taken 
in 
one 
of 
two 
widely 
different 
ways: 
(i) 
‘For 
He 
shall 
come 
as 
a 
pentup 
stream, 
which 
the 
breath 
of 
the 
LORD 
driverth’: 
so 
Vulg., 
cum 
’t 
quasi 
Auvius 
violentus. 
quem 
’n’
tu: 
Domini 
cogit: 
and 
so 
R.
V. 
and 
most 
modern 
authorities, 
but 
against 
the 
Heb. 
accents. 
(ii) 
‘When 
the 
adversary 
shall 
come 
in 
like 
a 
river, 
the 
Spirit 
of 
the 
LORD 
lifteth 
a 
banner 
against ’ 
So, 
practically 
A.
V., 
Peshitta, 
and 
Jewish 
authorities: 
Kay 
defends 
it: 
Alexander 
rather 
strangely 
endeavours 
to 
combine 
the 
ﬁrst 
clause 
of 
(i) 
with 
the 
second 
of(
ii).
Βίαιος 
is 
meant 
to 
render 
though 
whether 
as 
‘hostile,’ 
and 
so 
furious, 
or 
as 
‘pentin,’ 
and 
so 
violent, 
it 
is 
not 
easy 
to 
say. 
ὀργὴ 
is 
an 
attempt 
to 
explain 
‘breath’ 
or 
‘spirit.’ 
The 
connection 
of 
the 
last 
words 
with 
Heb. 
is 
quite 
obscure: 
the 
word 
DDJ 
causes 
difficulty. 
cf. 
x. 
Lxx. 
omit 
‘out 
of 
the 
mouth 
of 
thy 
seed'
s ’ 
either 
by 
inadvertence, 
or 
because 
the 
piledup 
reiteration 
seemed 
cumbrous 
and 
difficult 
to 
render 
in 
Greek, 
besides 
being 
virtually 
implied. 
The 
later 
Greek 
versions 
have 
it, 
and 
the 
Luc. 
MSS. 22 51 62 90 93 
supply 
it 
from 
them.
LX. 1. 
(beraw 
φωτίζου] 
Heb. 
‘Arise, 
shine.’ 
Perhaps 
membrance 
of 
li. 9, 
lii. 
I, 
led 
to 
the 
doubling 
of 
the 
word 
here; 
it 
seems 
unlikely 
that 
Lxx. 
read 
as 
preceding 
that 
word.

in 
the 
sense 
which 
Heb.

This

is 
attached 
by 
LXX. 
to 
‘thy

and 
second 
‘they

is 
omitted, 
which 
belongs 
in 
Heb. 
another 
verb 
was 
not 
needed, 
and 
it 
begins 
somewhat 
like 
‘and 
thy

ἐπ’ 
ὤμων] 
Heb. 
‘on 
the

cf. 
lxvi. 12. 
The 
translator 
did 
perhaps, 
realize 
the 
reference 
to 
the 
Eastern 
way 
of 
carrying 
children 
on 
the 
hip. 
xlix. 22 
is 
different 
in 
Heb.

LXX. 
omit 
‘and

or, 
‘be

better 
rendering 
than 
’flow

some 
think 
the

belong 
to 
two 
distinct 
words, 
but 
Delitzsch 
does 
not: 
cf. 
Ps. 
xxxiv. 5). 
The 
other

3rd

with 
‘heart’ 
for

ἐκστήσῃ] 
The 
idea 
is 
somewhat 
changed: 
Heb. 
‘shall ’: 
on 
which 
Del. 
remarks 
that 
this 
expression 
is 
strange 
to 
the 
classical 
languages, 
though 
its 
converse, 
of 
straitening, 
’ae, 
is 
familiar 
enough.
πλοῦτος] 
Heb. 
‘abundance’: 
cf. 
xxix. 5, 7.

LXX. 
omit 
‘wealth’ 
(lit. 
‘strength’) 
in 
this 
clause, 
but 
duplicate 
the 
genitive. 
The 
verbs 
which 
follow 
are 
attached 
in 
the

each 
to 
the 
following 
instead 
of 
the 
preceding

Heb. 
‘a

or 
‘inundation’: 
nearly 
the 
same 
word 
as 
in 
Deut. 
xxxiii. 19 
(πλοῦτος), 
and 
more 
exactly 
that

were 
descended 
from

spelling 
Γαιφὰρ 
in 
NAQ 
and 
many 
(B

Aq. 
Th. 
Symm. 
Γαιφὰ) 
may 
point 
to 
an 
uncertainty 
in 
the 
mind 
of 
the 
scribe 
or 
translator 
between 
‘Ephah’ 
and 
‘Epher,’ 
who 
stand 
next 
one 
another 
in 
Genesis. 
It 
is 
a 
question 
whether

to 
be 
identified 
with 
the 
Nabataei

Cedrei 
of

All 
the

appear 
to 
be 
nomadic

The

The

But 
probably, 
as 
suggested 
by

the

is 
a 
corruption 
of

The 
reading 
of 
this 
passage 
by 
our 
Lord 
is 
recorded, 
Luke 
iv. 17—19. 
As 
there 
given, 
the 
mat. 
is 
mainly 
followed; 
the 
words 
ἰάσασθαι. . . 
καρδίαν 
are 
omitted 
(by 
most 
good 
authorities); 
and 
a 
clause 
from 
lviii. 6, 
lxx., 
is 
inserted 
at 
the 
end 
of 
ver. 1. 
returning 
to 
the 
last 
clause 
of 
the 
quotation 
with 
κηρῦξαι 
instead 
of 
καλέσαι. 
The 
inserted 
clause 
from 
lviii. 6 
comes 
very 
near 
in 
meaning 
to 
that 
omitted.
τυφλοῖς 
ἀνάβλεψιν] 
Heb. 
‘opening 
to 
the 
bound’: 
the 
word 
for 
‘opening’ 
being 
a 
curious 
reduplicated 
form, 
printed, 
according 
to 
tradition, 
as 
two 
words. 
(Cf. 
the 
word 
rendered 
‘moles’ 
in 
ii. 20.) 
The 
ordinary 
form 
of 
the 
word 
is 
used 
of 
opening, 
specially, 
the 
eyes 
(or 
ears); 
as 
xxxv. 5, 
xlii. 7; 
hence 
Lxx. 
naturally 
took 
it 
so 
here, 
and 
τυφλοῖς 
is 
either 
intended 
to 
explain 
‘bound,’ 
regarded 
as 
a 
metaphorical 
phrase 
(mpti 
οψθλισ), 
or 
due 
to 
reading 
‘blind’ 
for 
‘bound’ 
as 
Del. 
apparently 
thinks. 
These 
two 
words 
occur 
in 
consecutive 
clauses, 
Ps. 
cxlvi. 7, 
ἀνταποδόσεις] 
After 
this, 
Lxx. 
omit 
‘for 
our 
God.
δοθῆναι] 
Lxx. 
thus 
translate 
‘to 
appoint,’ 
pass. 
for 
act., 
omitting 
the 
following 
‘to 
give,’ 
which 
repeats 
the 
former 
verb 
in 
a 
widened 
sense.
ἀντὶ] 
Kay, 
in 
his 
Introduction, 
in 
’s 
Comm., 
points 
out 
how 
the 
corresponding 
Heb. 
word, 
four 
times 
repeated 
here 
and 
in 
ver. 7, 
answers 
its 
ﬁvefold 
use 
in 
iii. 
δόξαν] 
The 
ordinary 
meaning 
of 
the 
more 
usual 
Heb. 
noun 
from 
this 
root: 
the 
present 
form 
is 
generally 
taken 
as=
a 
headdress 
of 
honour, 
‘turban’ 
or 
‘diadem.’ 
The 
Heb. 
has 
here 
a 
play 
on 
words, 
 instead 
of 
γενεαὶ] 
To 
explain 
‘oaks,’ 
here 
as 
“an 
emblem 
of

lxv. 22: 
Job 
viii. 16, 
PS. 
i. 3, 
Jerem. 
xvii. 8, 
ἃς.
ἀναστήσουσιν] 
The 
verb 
does 
not 
generally 
mean 
‘raise

but 
must 
have 
nearly 
that 
force 
here.

‘shall ’: 
possibly,

not 
necessarily,

So, 
in 
Acts

‘glory.’
θαυμασθήσεσθε] 
This 
verb, 
like 
παραδίδωμι, 
and 
a 
few 
others, 
has 
a 
tendency 
to 
occur 
in 
dubious 
passages: 
cf. 
lii. 15. 
Heb. 
has 
‘ve 
shall 
boast 
(yourselves),’ 
Vulg. 
’etz’
s: 
so 
some 
Jewish 
Vitringa, 
Delitzsch: 
many 
modems 
however 
render, 
‘to 
their 
glory 
shall 
ye 
succeed,’ 
with 
the 
idea 
of 
exchange. 
Del. 
thinks 
Lxx. 
is 
perhaps 
a 
free 
attempt 
at 
the 
fomier 
rendering, 
θαυμασθ. 
“in 
the 
sense 
of 
spectabiles 
eritis.’ 
For 
this 
use 
of 
θαυμάζω 
in

however, 
Lxx. 
read

that

warm 
for

cf. 
Habak.

The

they

in 
this 
respect.

Some 
have 
found 
the 
ﬁgure 
suggested  
 by 
this 
name, 
and 
worked 
out 
in

repugnant, 
logically 
and 
otherwise. 
But 
the 
breadth

range 
of 
Scriptural

transcend 
all 
ordinary 
ideas,

possible 
charges

This 
prophecy 
is 
generally 
regarded 
as 
separate 
from 
the 
foregoing, 
whether 
it 
is 
to 
be 
divided 
at 
ver. 7 
or 
not. 
Prof. 
W. 
E. 
Barnes, 
however, 
thinks 
otherwise, 
connecting 
it 
with 
lxii. 1012 
Edom 
is 
often 
the 
type 
of 
a 
special 
and 
bitter 
enemy 
of 
Israel: 
cf. 
xxxiv. 
(esp. 5—8), 
Ezek. 
xxv. 12—14, 
xxxv., 
Obadiah, 1—4, 
Amos 
i. 9, 11, 12, 
Ps. 
cxxxvii. 7. 
But 
it 
is 
also 
the 
whence 
God 
advances 
to 
manifest 
Himself 
in 
triumph: 
He 
comes 
from 
Seir 
and 
Edom, 
judg. 
v. 4 
(cf. 
the 
next 
verse 
with 
lxiv. 1); 
from 
Teman 
and 
Paran, 
Habak. 
iii. 3; 
while 
Deut. 
xxxiii. 2 
joins 
Paran 
and 
Teman 
with 
Sinai.
Ἐδὼμ. . . 
Βόσοπ] 
Edom 
is 
akin 
to 
the 
word 
meaning 
‘red,’ 
and 
Bozrah 
to 
that 
for 
‘vintage.’ 
Some 
have 
wished, 
therefore, 
to 
emend 
the 
Heb. 
accordingly; 
but 
not. 
evidently 
give 
no 
support 
to 
the 
idea.

the

more 
exactly 
a

of 
a

‘to

and 
hence, 
probably, 
vivid

Evidently, 
from 
what 
follows, 
there 
is 
something 
strange 
and 
striking 
in 
the 
appearance.
οὗτος 
ἀραῖος] 
Perhaps 
οὗτος, 
as 
read 
by 41 48 62 87 93 106 147, 
is 
the 
right 
text:

Vulg.

formosus, 
Tertull. 
decorus 
Originally 
the 
word 
means 
‘swelling,’ 
the 
word 
used 
of 
the 
“tumid 
hills” 
in 
xlv. 2; 
the 
word 
is 
akin 
to 
that 
in 
Ps. 
civ. 1 
εὐπρέπειαν.

Lxx.

the 
word 
‘travelling’ 
(so 
A.

which 
is 
that 
used 
in 
Ii. 14 
(Heb), 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
bowing 
down. 
Gesenius 
and 
Cheyne 
render, 
‘tossing 
the ’: 
Delitzsch, 
‘bending,’ 
or 
‘swaying 
to

with 
which 
idea 
we 
may 
perhaps 
compare 
the 
phrase 
in 
Judg. 
ix. 9, 11, 12, 
‘to 
wave 
to

over 
the

some 
think 
represents

corresponds 
to 
with

(of 
strength): 
but 
possibly 
was 
taken 
as 
as 
later 
in 
the 
verse: 
‘strife,’ 
and 
so 
‘violence’: 
Tertull. 
has 
’olmta 
cum 
’tua’
z’
ne.
κρίσιν] 
Here 
mighty, 
is 
clearly 
taken 
as 
or 
a 
‘suit’ 
or 
strife, 
and 
then, 
according 
to 
one 
development 
of 
the 
’s 
meaning, 
a 
judgment 
or 
decision. 
Tertullian 
omits 
this 
clause.
ἐρυθρὰ 
τὰ 
ἱμάτια] 
Heb. 
has 
‘Why

red 
on 
thy 
πατητοῦ] 
Q 
reads 
πατήματος, 
which 
might 
be 
a 
marginal 
note 
to 
show 
how 
πατητοῦ 
should 
be 
taken. 
But 
Cypr. 
Epist. 
lxiii. 7 
has 
velut 
a 
’one 
’s: 
Jerome, 
on 
this 
passage, 
sicut 
calcantium 
Iorcular. 
ληνὸς 
seems 
to 
be 
by 
implication 
feminine 
in 
the 
next 
clause: 
but 
πατητοῦ 
might 
be 
regarded 
as 
of 
two 
terminations.
πλήρης 
καταπεπατημένης] 
LXX. 
have 
omitted 
‘alone’: 
πλήρης 
corresponds 
in 
place 
to 
‘winetrough,’ 
which 
is 
a 
different 
word 
from 
‘winepress’ 
in 
ver. 2, 
and 
occurs 
elsewhere 
only 
in 
Haggai 
ii. 
The 
only 
way 
to 
translate, 
if 
the 
verses 
be 
divided 
as 
in 
the 
Heb., 
will 
be, 
‘(I 
am) 
full 
with 
the 
trodden 
(press).’ 
So 
(see 
Vol. 
I. 
p. 34) 
Sabatier 
on 
this 
passage 
quotes 
from 
Nobilius, 
“id 
est, 
oppletus 
sum,’ 
which 
he 
gives 
as 
a 
rendering 
with 
reserve 
as 
to 
the 
of 
the 
text.
But 
ℵQmg, 
and 
several 
cursives, 
read 
πλήρους. 
Cyprian'
s 
quotation 
continues 
(torccularis) 
pleni 
et 
conculcati, 
while 
Tertullian 
has 
sicut 
dc 
fora ’: 
piano 
conculcato, 
and 
JerOme 
tormlar 
plenum 
conculcatum. 
This 
evidence 
seems 
to 
converge 
in 
favour 
of 
reading 
πλήρους 
καταπεπατημένης, 
and 
carrying 
down 
the 
sentence 
to 
that 
point. 
The 
evidence 
for 
πλήρης 
however 
is 
very 
strong: 
and 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
whereas 
a 
genitive 
seems 
preferable, 
πλήρης 
may 
be 
taken 
as 
indeclinable. 
See 
Hort, 
Introd. 
to 
NT. 
in 
Greek, 
Appendix, 
p. 24, 
on 
Mark 
iv. 28, 
where 
he 
suggests 
that 
πλήρης 
is 
to 
be 
read, 
as 
indeclin 
able, 
there 
and 
in 
Acts 
vi. 5 
(where 
A 
has 
it 
also 
in 
ver. 3). 
So 
Γ 
reads 
πλήρης 
in 1. 15, 
and 
B 
in 
Ii. 20; 
cf. 
A, 
in 2 
Kings 
vi. 17. 
If 
then 
we 
place 
the 
stop 
after 
καταπεπατημένης, 
and 
regard 
πλήρης 
as 
genit., 
the 
resulting 
sentence 
is 
no 
doubt 
incoherent 
and 
illbalanced. 
But 
this 
is 
not 
decisive 
against 
it, 
and 
the 
evidence 
is 
considerable 
that 
it 
was 
so 
taken 
in 
ancient 
times.
κατεπάτησα. . . 
κατέθλασα. . 
.κατήγαγον] 
There 
is 
general 
agreement 
that 
the 
Heb. 
verbs 
are 
to 
be 
treated 
as 
past, 
the 
vowelpoints 
being, 
if 
necessary, 
altered 
to 
make 
the 
conversive 
(consecutive). 
But 
can 
they 
not 
be 
regarded 
as 
frequentative?
For 
the 
repeated 
preposition, 
cf. 
Aesch. 
Agam. 1410, 
ἀπέδικες, 
ἀπέταμες, 
ἀπόπολις

κατέθλασα] 
See 
below, 
on 
ver. 
ὥς

Perhaps 
reading 
‘as 
earth,’ 
for 
mm: 
‘in 
my 
fury.
κατήγαγον. . . 
εἰς 
γῆν] 
There 
is 
apparently 
some 
confusion 
with 
ver. 6. 
The 
Heb. 
word 
for 
‘blood’ 
(literally 
‘juice,’ 
keeping 
up 
the 
figure) 
occurs 
only 
in 
these 
two 
verses. 
B* 
omits 
εἷς 
γῆν.
ἐπῆλθεν 
αὐτοῖς] 
Heb. 
‘(is) 
in 
my ’ 
the 
Greek 
might 
represent 
λυτρώσεως] 
Heb. 
generally 
taken 
‘of 
my 
redeemed 
ones': 
but 
many, 
including 
Del. 
and 
Cheyne, 
treat 
the 
plur. 
as 
equivalent 
to 
an 
abstract 
term: 
‘of 
my 
redemption.’ 
With 
this 
Lxx. 
substantially 
agrees, 
and 
also 
Vulg. 
amm: 
’om’: 
meat.
Cf. 
lix. 
Hm] 
Heb. 
‘supported 
me’ ( 
ἐστηρίσατο, 
lix. 16). 
The 
Greek 
verb 
seems 
to 
be 
equivalent 
in 
meaning 
to 
instare.
The 
middle 
clause, 
‘and 
made 
them 
drunk 
in 
my 
fury.’ 
is 
omitted 
by 
Lxx. 
(supplied 
in 
Luc. 
cursives 
from 
Hexaplaric 
text, 
due 
to 
Th. 
Symm.). 
Many 
authorities, 
including 
several 
Heb. 
MSS., 
read 
‘shatter’ 
for 
‘make 
drunk.’ 
If 
Lxx. 
had 
read 
thus, 
it 
may 
be 
that 
the 
confusion 
between 
this 
verse 
and 
ver. 3, 
which 
might 
naturally 
πίω, 
explains 
the 
presence 
of 
κατέθλασα 
above.
αἷμα] 
As 
above, 
ver. 3, 
though 
A.
V. 
and 
Vulg. 
(sanguis. . . 
virtutem) 
both 
change 
their 
rendering.
ἐμνίσθην] 
Heb. 
has 
the 
impf.=
future.
κριτὴς] 
Heb. 
‘abundance,’ 
see 
on 
ver. 1. 
not. 
divides 
the 
sentences 
differently 
from 
the 
Heb. 
accents, 
and 
κριτὴς 
is 
hardly 
a 
possible 
rendering, 
in 
any 
case.
ὑπάγει] 
Heb. 
‘bestows 
in ’: 
see 
on 
lix. 
δικαιοσύνῃ] 
Heb. 
‘lovingkindnesses’: 
the 
converse 
of 
the 
difference 
in 
lvi. 1, 
lix. 16. 
Cf. 
δίκαιον 
in 
lvii. 1 1: 
also 
Gen. 
xx. 13, 
xxi. 
The 
negative, 
with 
a 
question, 
comes 
to 
the 
same 
sense 
as 
Heb: 
but 
Lxx. 
may 
have 
read 
wrongly.
ἀθετήσωσιν] 
Cf. 
i. 2, 
xxi. 2, 
c. 
This 
verb 
is 
used 
with 2 
Kings 
i. 1; 
with 
εἷς, 
as 1 
Kings 
xii. 19: 
often 
with 
simple 
accus., 
or 
absolutely, 
as 
here. 
Heb. 
has 
here 
‘deal 
falsely’: 
ἀθετέω 
also 
renders 
‘act 
treacherously’ 
or 
‘barbarously,’ 
without 
regard 
for 
obligations 
or 
feelings: 
and 
(generally 
with 
prepos.) 
‘rebel.’
ἐκ 
πόσης 
θλίψεως] 
LXX. 
connect 
this 
with 
ver. 8, 
and 
possibly 
read 
D 
for 3 
before 
the 
noun.
οὔ 
πρέσβεις] 
All 
MSS. 
but 
A 
have 
the 
sing., 
i.
e. 
‘a 
messenger 
for 
and 
the 
negative, 
with 
Heb. 
text, 
which 
the 
margin 
directs 
to 
be 
read 
as 15 
‘to 
him.’ 
Most 
opinions 
are 
in 
favour 
of 
this 
latter: 
‘In 
all 
their 
distress 
He 
was ’: 
but 
a 
few 
follow 
the 
‘written’ 
text, 
and 
render, 
‘In 
all 
their 
adversity 
he 
was 
no 
adversary’: 
less 
probably, 
‘there 
was 
no 
real 
ﬁliction.’ 
Kay'
s 
note 
in 
favour 
of 
the 
negative, 
Delitzsch'
s 
and 
’s 
against 
it, 
should 
be 
consulted.
The 
quotations 
of 
this 
verse 
in 
the 
O.
L. 
patristic 
writers 
are 
examined 
by

Burkitt 
in 
his

Possibly 
the 
right 
meaning, 
at 
any 
rate 
one 
which 
the

Heb. 
verb 
can 
bear. 
Cf.

‘Moses,

which 
is 
considered 
a 
difficult 
phrase 
in 
the 
Heb., 
and 
Profs. 
Cheyne 
and 
Skinner 
think 
it 
is 
made 
up 
of 
marginal 
glosses 
on 
‘the 
shepherd’ 
and 
‘flock’ 
below. 
Hitzig, 
Ewald, 
Del., 
and 
Prof. 
W. 
E. 
Barnes 
make 
‘people’ 
the 
subject 
of 
the 
verb, 
and 
construe, 
‘Then 
remembered 
his 
people 
the 
ancient 
days 
of ’: 
the 
chief 
objection 
to 
which 
is, 
that 
it 
is 
a 
little 
too 
ingenious. 
Others 
have 
taken 
the 
phrase, 
‘the 
Moses,’ 
i.
e. 
the 
deliverer, 
‘of 
his 
people.

τὸν

The 
Heb. 
MSS. 
are 
divided 
between 
the 
sing. 
and 
plural, 
the 
highest 
modern 
authorities 
on 
the 
whole 
favouring 
the 
latter. 
Del. 
supports 
A.
V. 
in 
taking 
as 
‘with’ 
rather 
than 
as 
the 
sign 
of 
the 
accus.; 
so 
Vulg. 
cum 
pastoribus. 
Ps. 
lxxvii. 20 
is 
quoted 
in 
support 
of 
the 
plural. 
Heb. 
is 
thus 
generally 
taken, 
‘Where 
is 
he 
that 
brought 
them 
up...
with 
the 
shepherds 
(or, 
shepherd) 
of 
his

but 
a 
few 
take 
it 
as 
Lxx.
Μωσῆ] 
’s 
reading 
may 
be 
intended 
for 
the 
genitive 
case, 
which 
would 
be 
nearer 
to 
Heb. 
as 
it 
is 
generally 
construed: 
‘that 
caused 
the 
arm 
of 
his 
glory 
to 
go 
at 
the 
right 
hand 
of 
Moses.’ 
LXX. 
have 
kept 
the 
words 
in 
their 
order, 
but 
altered 
the 
syntax. ( 
Μωσῆ 
would 
regularly 
be 
genitive: 
but 
no 
other 
MS.

it, 
and 
the

Heb. 
has 
no 
connecting 
particle, 
and 
begins 
a 
new 
comparison 
here, 
at 
least 
according 
to 
most 
authorities.
πεδίον] 
Heb. 
‘valley’ 
or 
‘cleft,’ 
word 
akin 
to 
‘dividing’ 
in 
ver. 12. 
LXX. 
however 
render 
elsewhere 
by

as 
Josh. 
xi. 17, 
xii. 
κατέβη] 
ln 
Heb., 
the 
subject 
of 
this 
verb 
is 
‘beast’ 
(sing); 
Lxx. 
transfer 
it 
to 
πνεῦμα, 
and 
couple 
the 
next 
verb 
by

Reading 
untan, 
‘gave 
him ’ 
probably 
as 
 from 
‘lead.’ 50 
Vulg. 
ductor

Ἐπίστραψον] 
Heb. 
‘loolt,’ 
‘take 
notice.
πλῆθος] 
Often 
for 
Heb. 
non, 
‘sound’ 
or 
‘multitude,’ 
as 
xvii. 12 
πλοῦτος 
is 
sometimes 
used; 
both 
words 
in 
xxix. 5, 
and 
a 
variant 
reading 
in ℵ 
of 
lx. 5. 
Here 
the 
Heb. 
idea, 
which 
is 
as 
in 
xvi. 
II, 
is 
softened 
down; 
έλέους 
being 
used 
for 
the 
supposed 
physical 
seat 
of 
compassion, 
the 
bowels (1 
John 
iii. 17), 
and 
πλῆθος 
giving 
a 
different 
aspect 
to 
the 
phrase.
ἀνέσχου] 
The 
person 
of 
this 
verb, 
and 
consequently 
the 
sense, 
are 
altered 
from 
Heb.
ὅτι] 
The 
particle 
is 
rightly 
rendered 
here 
by 
Lxx.
ῥῦσαι] 
Heb. 
has 
a 
participle, 
and 
Lxx. 
have 
divided 
the 
clauses 
differently: 
ἐστὶν 
ἐν 
ἡμῖν 
A, 
or 
ἐφ’ 
ἡμᾶς 
ἐστιν 
Β 
&amp;
c. 
is 
not 
in 
Heb., 
perhaps 
comes, 
in 
the 
latter 
form, 
from 
ver. 
κληρονομήσωμεν] 
3rd 
pers. 
pl. 
in 
Heb., 
a 
diff. 
root 
from 
that 
rendered 
κληρονομίας 
just 
above. 
ἵνα 
is 
inserted, 
perhaps 
induced 
by 5 
before 
‘a 
little,’ 
which 
might 
seem 
to 
suggest 
purpose.
δρονι] 
As 
though 
reading 
‘mountain’ 
for 
Dy 
‘people’: 
several 
commentators 
have 
approved 
this, 
principally 
because 
the 
verb 
is 
thought 
to 
require 
an 
object. 
But 
see 
Deut. 
ii. 24, 31 
(so 
Delitzsch).
οἱ 
ὐπεναντίοι. . . 
ἀγίασμά

Omitted 
by 
RB, 
perhaps 
because 
their 
original 
(the 
original 
Lxx. ?) 
missed 
out 
from 
the 
first 
to 
the 
second 
in 
Heb. 
The 
clause, 
as 
supplied 
in 
AQV 
and 
almost 
all 
is 
not 
marked 
as 
Hexaplaric 
by 
Q, 
nor 
would 
its 
attestation 
suggest 
that: 
yet 
it 
scarcely 
approves 
itself 
as 
belonging 
to 
the 
true 
Lxx. 
here.
τὸ 
ἀπ’ 
ἀρχῆς] 
In 
Heb. 
this 
goes 
with 
the 
following 
negative: 
‘never.’ 
The 
particles 
ὡς, 
ὅτε 
are 
inserted, 
and 
ἡμᾶς 
is 
for 
a 
3rd 
pers.
The 
Hebrew 
verse 
includes 
lxiv. 
I, 
as 
divided 
in 
LXX., 
Vulg., 
and 
A.
V. 
The 
connection 
seems 
to 
be 
close: 
Del. 
defends 
the 
Heb. 
division 
of 
the 
verses, 
and 
the 
chapterdivision 
is 
of 
later 
origin.

Ἐὰν] 
Conditional 
particles 
are 
used 
in 
Heb., 
as 
in 
many 
languages, 
to 
express 
wish: 
Davidson, 
Heb. 
Syntax, 
ἓ 135 
Rem. 1, 
points 
out 
Gen. 
xxiv. 42, 
Exod. 
xxxii. 32, 
as 
instances 
of 
a 
transitional 
stage.
ἀνοίξῃς] 
Heb.

ἐσχισμένον, 
Gen.

‘melt,’ 
cf. 
Ps. 
lxviii. 2, 
and 
translated 
accordingly, 
τήκεται, 
and 
κηρὸς 
may 
be 
a 
guess 
for 
mp, 
‘kindleth,’ 
or 
else 
these 
words 
may 
have 
been 
rendered 
conversely: 
the 
order 
is 
in 
favour 
of 
the 
former 
view, 
but 
the 
verse 
in 
the 
psalm, 
which 
at 
any 
rate 
probably 
accounts 
for 
προσώπου 
in 
A, 
may 
have 
affected 
the 
rendering 
here.
κατακαύσει] 
Heb. 
‘makes 
water 
to 
boil.’ 
Lxx. 
omit 
‘water. 
perhaps 
losing 
sight 
of

after 
D'

Supplied 
as

to

from 
the

For 
the 
same 
Heb., 
Ps. 
cvi. 22 
has 
φοβερά.
In 
I 
Cor. 
ii. 9, 
St 
Paul 
is 
generally 
considered 
to 
be 
quoting 
freely 
from 
this 
passage, 
his 
quotation 
being 
neither 
exactly 
with 
Heb. 
nor 
with 
lxx., 
but 
fairly 
near 
the 
latter, 
with 
a 
clause 
incorporated 
from 
lxv. 
Clement 
of 
Rome 
has 
a 
quotation 
(Ep. 
Cor. 
xxxiv.), 
which 
resembles 
that 
of 
St 
Paul, 
but 
is 
nearer 
to 
Lxx. 
in 
having 
ὑπομένουσιν 
for

which 
indeed 
is 
read 
by

parallel 
meaning; 
this 
Lxx. 
omits, 
but 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
supplies 
τὰ 
ἔργα

ποιήσεις 
also 
corresponds 
to 
a 
3rd 
pers. 
(sing.) 
in 
Heb.
θεὸν 
πλὴν

A* 
omits, 
probably 
a 
mere 
clerical 
error.
τὰ 
ἔργα 
σου] 
Luc. 
MSS. 
add 
ἀληθινὰ. 
The 
old 
emendation, 
a 
λήθει, 
is 
disposed 
of 
by 
Field, 
in 
his 
Hexapla.
There 
are 
differences 
of 
person 
in 
the 
verbs. 
Lxx. 
omit 
‘him  
 that 
rejoiceth.' 
except 
that 
ἵλεος 
is 
supplied 
in 
a 
few 
texts 
in 
that 
place. 
The 
end 
of 
the 
verse 
is 
also 
different; 
Heb. 
is 
obscure, 
and 
is 
literally, 
‘in 
them 
long 
time, 
and 
we 
shall 
be 
saved.' 
‘ln 
them' 
would 
most 
naturally 
mean 
‘in 
our 
sins,' 
and 
in 
that 
case 
it 
seems 
almost 
a 
necessity 
to 
take 
the 
verb 
as 
interrogative.

for 
‘thou

melted

according 
to 
’s 
probable 
explanation. 
Yet, 
as 
Del. 
points 
out, 
the

in 
Heb., 
in 
this 
context, 
is 
equivalent 
to 
’z’

With 
LXX. 
cf.

Perhaps 
reading 
nits 
or 
mm 
‘in

for 
 ‘for

The 
clauses 
are 
divided 
differently 
in 
Heb. 
and 
Lxx. 
The 
phrase 
‘thy 
holy ’ 
in 
Heb., 
does 
not 
occur 
elsewhere. 
Vulg.

has 
the

The

Perhaps

rendering 
of 
Heb. 
‘a

not 
very 
near 
to 
none, 
but 
is 
possibly 
what 
Lxx. 
read. 
For 
the 
Greek

cf.

‘desirable

cf.

whether 
this 
chapter 
begins 
with 
an 
answer 
to 
the 
appeals 
at 
the 
end 
of 
lxiv.,

form 
a

ἔπερωτῶσιν] 
So 
RAQ 
and 
several 
cursives: 
B 
and 
most 
Lucianic 
cursives 
have 
the 
converse 
order, 
agreeing 
with 
Heb. 
Cypr. 
Testim. 
I. 21 
has 
quaerunt. . . 
interrogabant, 
and 
the 
quotation 
in 
Rom. 
x. 20, 21 
agrees 
with 
RA 
(ἐγενόμην 
also 
for 
ἐγενήθην), 
as 
to 
the 
participles, 
but

Not 
repeated

On 
the 
whole, 
AQ*'
s 
reading, 
which 
is 
furthest 
from 
the 
Heb., 
seems 
most 
likely 
to 
be 
the 
real 
LXX., 
or 
near 
it; 
but 
the

being 
doubleedged.

Points 
the

‘thoughts’ 
(lv.8,9).
θυσιάζουσιν] 
A 106 309 
read 
θυμιάζουσιν, 
but 
this 
is 
probably 
a 
mistake, 
by 
confusion 
with 
the 
following 
verb.
τοῖς 
δαιμονίοις 
ἃ 
οὐκ 
ἔσται] 
Not 
in 
Heb., 
which 
has 
only 
‘which 
sit ‘ 
in 
this 
place, 
belonging 
to 
ver. 4. 
Possibly 
LXX. 
read 
as 
some 
word 
from 
the 
root 
so 
often 
associated 
with 
false 
gods.
δι’ 
ἐνύπνια] 
Not 
in 
Heb., 
but 
explains 
the 
verb, 
probably 
rightly. 
“Ut

This 
will 
certainly 
render 
the 
reading 
of 
Heb. 
marg., 
 as 
in 
Judg. 
vi. 19, 20: 
the 
text, 
is 
perhaps 
rather

θυσιῶν 
agrees 
best 
in 
connection, 
but 
μεμολυμμένα 
in

would 
be 
an 
easy 
inadvertence 
before 
‘vessels.’ 
which

no 
prepos. 
expressed 
in 
Heb.
καθαρὸς] 
LXX. 
omit 
the 
2nd 
pers. 
suffix, 
which 
may 
make 
the 
Heb. 
expression 
mean 
‘I 
sanctify 
thee,’ 
rendering 
the 
person 
incapable 
of 
the 
ordinary 
duties 
and 
associations 
of 
life: 
or, 
‘I 
am 
holy 
as 
regards ’ 
which 
is 
grammatically 
a 
difficult 
use 
of 
the 
suffix.
Θυμοῦ] 
The 
word 
for 
‘nose’ 
means 
also 
‘amger’: 
Exod. 
xv. 8 
PS. 
xviii. 15, 
Job 
iv. 
ἴως 
ἂν] 
‘Until’ 
or 
‘unless’ 
mean 
nearly 
the 
same; 
‘except 
first’ 
perhaps 
expresses 
the 
meaning 
more 
fully: 
cf. 
Gen. 
xxxii. 26 
and 
lv. 10. 
Del. 
explains 
the 
construction 
in 
Heb. 
as 
an 
ellipse, 
see 
his

with 
Heb. 
and 
the 
later 
versions 
of 
Aq. 
Symm. 
B'
s 
ἀποδώσω 
may 
be 
due 
to 
confusion 
with 
ver. 7, 
or 
a 
mistake, 
by 
haplography, 
in 
copying 
the 
fuller 
text 
as 
in 
RQ.
LXX. 
omit 
‘together.

An 
alternative 
(late) 
form 
of 
ῥάξ, 
a 
‘grape’ 
or 
‘berry’ 
(xvii. 6) 
Heb. 
has 
‘the 
the 
new

or 
‘must,’ 
meaning, 
however, 
in 
the 
sound 
grapes.

The 
first

is 
connected 
by

with 
the 
previous 
verse, 
the

having 
been 
taken 
by 
them 
as

The 
phrase 
occurs, 
of 
course, 
Gen. 
ii. 9, 
iii. 22, 
but 
we 
know 
of 
nothing 
that 
renders 
it 
really 
appropriate. 
Without 
the

s 
addition 
of

the

is 
simple, 
and 
occurs 
also 
Ps.

Possibly

Belongs 
to 
the 
previous 
verse 
in 
Heb., 
as 
subj. 
of 
the 
last 
verb.
εἰς 
κατάραν] 
Heb. 
here 
difers 
from 
lxiv. 
to, 
and 
is 
‘for ’ 
or 
‘ruin.’ 
Scholz 
suggests 
that 
LXX. 
read 
for 
Delitzsch 
says 
their 
rendering 
is 
‘perhaps 
according 
to 
the 
was 
loquendi 
of 
the 
Egyptian 
Jews,’ 
a 
rather 
persuasive 
suggestion: 
Prof. 
(Lina 
of 
szma, 
p. 26) 
that 
the 
translator 
“interprets 
a 
Hebrew 
word...
from 
the 
Arabic, 
or 
more 
probably 
Nabataean— 
‘curse,’ 
‘confusion.‘‘
ἐρῶ

Cf. 
lviii. 9, 
Dan.

The 
touch 
of 
Greek 
liveliness, 
not 
very 
common 
in 
LXX., 
for 
Heb. 
‘I 
will

more 
or 
less 
paralleled 
in 
Jonah 
i. 6, 
Τί 
συ 
ῥέγχεις; 
Exod. 
iii. 
Cf. 
xi. 6 
foll. 
The 
new 
clause 
continues 
the 
sense 
of 
contrast 
between 
the 
chosen 
and 
the 
wicked 
in 
their 
fate. 
Del. 
remarks, 
the 
serpent 
”will 
no 
more 
threaten 
man'
s 
life, 
but 
be 
content 
with 
the 
food 
assigned 
to 
it 
in 
Gen. 
iii. 14.” 
Yet 
the 
curse 
seems 
here 
to 
a 
milder 
sound.
LXVI.

τίς

is 
however 
read 
by 
the 
best 
MSS. 
in 
N.
T.: 
any 
other 
variations 
seem 
due 
to 
the. 
enforcing 
of 
the

words 
by 
the 
speaker: 
cf. 
Exod. 
iv. 
The 
omission 
of

is 
apparently 
mere 
inadvertence.
ἐστιν 
lid] 
The 
possessive 
pron.

not

Heb., 
which 
probably 
means 
‘came

Vulg.
ἐπὶ

ἀλλ᾿

The 
rhetorical 
question 
is 
not 
in 
Heb., 
which 
has 
‘to

namely) 
to....
ἡσύχιον] 
Rather 
a 
free 
rendering 
for 
‘contrite,’ 
‘smitten’: 
but  
 probably 
intended 
as 
a 
parallel 
word 
to 
ταπεινός. 
It 
is 
not 
easy 
to 
see 
what 
else 
Lxx. 
can 
have 
read: 
or 
for 
hardly 
seems 
to 
mend 
matters.
DUI. 
omit 
the 
second 
part 
of 
the 
first 
clause, 
and 
the 
ﬁrst 
part 
of 
the 
second, 
thus 
condensing 
the 
passage, 
though 
probably 
by 
inadvertence. 
The 
participial 
form 
of 
the 
clauses 
is 
as 
Heb.
ὁ 
δὲ 
ἄνομος] 
This 
addition 
by 
Lxx. 
is, 
according 
to 
Scholz, 
due 
to 
reading 
nmw, 
‘he 
that

in 
duplicate, 
the 
first

But 
it 
is 
perhaps 
more 
probably 
inserted 
to 
ease 
the 
abrupt

σεμίδαλιν] 
The

The

The

not 
much 
affected, 
except 
as 
to 
the

of 
the

βδελυσσομένοις] 
Represents 
the 
spirit 
of 
the 
Heb. 
well 
enough: 
the 
word, 
lit. 
‘thrust ’ 
had 
later 
the 
sense 
of 
‘banning,’ 
putting 
‘out

ἐξέφυγεν

This 
seems 
to 
duplicate 
the 
Heb. 
in 
two 
senses, 
but 
the 
intransitive 
ἐξέφυγεν 
would 
not 
be 
grammatical. 
The

unless 
it 
could 
mean 
‘escaped

‘Υea,

(or 
‘also...’).
ἔδωκα

ταύτην] 
LXX. 
seem 
to 
have 
taken 
 ‘I 
caused 
to ’ 
as 
though 
from 
‘hope,’ 
expanding 
it 
in 
translation, 
in 
a 
causal 
sense.
ἑμνήσθης] 
If 
Lxx. 
read 
or 
for

will 
cause

forth1), 
it 
would 
no 
doubt 
have 
been 
represented 
by 
ἐμνήσθην, 
and 
the 
persons 
of 
verbs 
are 
frequently 
changed 
by 
Lxx. 
Much 
the 
same 
might 
be 
said 
if 
they 
read 
from 
‘praise,’ 
though 
ἐμνήσθην 
would 
be 
a 
less 
likely 
rendering 
in 
that 
case. 
There 
seems 
no 
connection

the 
idea 
of 
remembrance, 
except 
the 
use 
of 
the 
Hithpael 
in 
Numb. 
i. 18, 
‘recorded 
pedigrees’; 
and 
seems 
decidedly 
too 
farfetched. 
LXX.

have 
missed 
the

with 
which

is 
intended 
to 
be 
literal 
for

may 
be 
right:

many, 
including 
Del.

For

the

lit. 
εἰσόδου] 
Heb. 
is 
obscure. 
In 
Ps. 1. 11 
ὡραιότης), 
lxxx. 13 
(μονιὸς), 
it 
is 
said 
to 
mean 
‘that 
which 
moveth 
in’ 
(the 
field): 
there 
is 
some 
doubt 
as 
to 
its 
being 
the 
same 
word. 
Some 
think 
it, 
by 
Arabic 
analogy, 
to 
be 
a 
parallel 
word 
to 
‘breast,’ 
‘teat’ 
or 
‘udder’: 
others 
have 
taken 
it 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
‘universality.’ 
Delitzsch 
discredits 
these 
views, 
and 
explains 
it 
as 
‘fulness 
to 
the 
brim,’ 
from 
root 
meaning 
motion. 
‘Abundance’ 
seems 
to 
give 
the 
general 
sense. 
LXX. 
were 
probably 
in 
the 
dark 
“The 
ancient

εἰσόδου

for 
σεβομένοις 
is 
mainly 
Hesychian, 
but 
on 
a 
point 
like 
this 
perhaps 
the 
best. 
Heb. 
‘his 
servants.
καὶ 
ἀπειλήσει] 
Taking 
as 
a 
verb, 
probably 
rightly.
ἀποσκορακισμὸν] 
The 
cognate 
verb, 
Heb. 
and 
Gr., 
xvii. 13: 
this 
Heb. 
noun, 
xxx. 17, 
Ii. 20 
(with 
its 
parallel): 
also 
Ps. 
lxxx. 16, 
and  
 a 
nearlyconnected 
word 
in 
Deut. 
xxviii. 20. 
ἐκδίκησιν 
is 
a 
working 
up 
of 
‘anger,’ 
to 
suit 
ἀποδοῦναι 
on 
one 
side, 
and 
κριθήσεται 
on 
the 
other.
Α* 
inadvertently 
(cf. 17 
ﬁn.) 
has 
καταναλωθήσεται 
for 
κριθήσεται. 
Heb., 
though 
passive 
in 
form, 
has 
here 
a 
quasiactive 
meaning, 
‘enter 
into 
judgment’: 
LXX., 
taking 
it 
as 
an 
ordinary 
passive, 
supplied 
πᾶσα 
ἡ 
γῆ 
as 
a 
subject. 
The 
Heb. 
in 
iii. 14, 
as 
in 
Ps. 
cxliii. 2 
is 
a 
different 
form.
τραυματίαι] 
Heb. 
is 
regularly 
rendered 
‘slain,‘ 
but 
is 
properly 
‘smitten’ 
(see 
xxii. 2, 
c.). 
Cf. 
Zeph. 
ii. 
ἐν 
τοῖς 
προθύροις] 
Heb. 
has 
here 
a 
difficult 
phrase, 
‘behind 
one 
in 
the 
midst.’ 
‘One,’ 
according 
to 
the 
Heb. 
text, 
is 
masc. 
and 
this 
is 
generally 
taken 
to 
refer 
to 
a 
scene, 
as 
in 
Ezek. 
viii. 11, 
the 
‘one’ 
being 
the 
officiating 
hierophant, 
followed 
by 
the 
worshippers, 
or 
surrounded 
by 
them: 
“in 
the 
midst 
of 
them 
stood 
Jaazaniah 
the 
son 
of 
Shaphan, 
with 
every 
man 
his 
censer 
in 
his 
hand.” 
(Some 
tried 
to 
find 
the 
name 
of 
a 
heathen 
deity 
in 
the 
words, 
but 
this 
is 
hardly 
satisfactory.) 
If 
the 
Heb. 
margin 
be 
taken, 
‘one’ 
is 
feminine, 
which 
is 
interpreted 
as 
meaning 
one 
‘tree’ 
or 
êrah, 
in 
the 
midst 
of 
the 
garden. 
The 
phrase 
‘behind 
one,’ 
is 
to 
produce 
confusion: 
some 
have 
suggested 
reading 
‘one 
and 
another’; 
or 
inserting 
before 
as 
well 
as 
after 
 after 
another.
What 
Lxx. 
read 
is 
hard 
to 
guess: 
possibly 
‘benind 
a ’ 
as 
Vulg. 
has 
past 
ianuam. 
LXX. 
at 
this 
part 
of 
the 
book 
seem 
to 
use 
more 
freedom 
in 
translating, 
and 
often 
omit 
‘in 
the 
midst,’ 1, 3, 
c. 
Or, 
if 
they 
omitted 
the 
two 
difficult 
words, 
ἐν 
προθύροις 
might 
conceivably 
be 
(Dan. 
ii. 49)

not 
what

Ezek;

Nah.

the

as

Heb. 
has

Most

and 
explain 
Pul

Hitzig

mistake 
due 
to 
the 
name 
of 
the 
Assyrian 
king 
in 2 
Kings

(Margoliouth) 
or 
a 
clerical 
error. 
VVetzstein

Pun,

but 
this 
involves 
alteration 
of 
both

Without 
expressing 
any 
opinion 
as 
to 
Put 
being 
the 
right 
form 
here, 
it 
may 
be 
urged 
that 
the 
evidence 
of 
mm. 
does 
not 
really 
take 
us 
very 
far: 
for 
(a) 
except 
in 
Gen. 
x. 6, 
the 
name 
is 
not 
elsewhere 
transliterated 
in 
leading 
uncials, 
apart 
from 
Qmg 
in 
Ezek. 
xxvii. 10 
(b) 
their 
spelling 
of 
proper 
names 
is 
often 
untrustworthy, 
not 
least 
in 
the 
Prophets: 
Pul 
himself 
appears 
in 2 
Kings 
as 
Kings 
as 
θουά: 
θοὺδ 
is 
almost 
as 
much 
in 
favour 
of 
Pul 
as 
of 
Put, 
Δ 
and 
A 
being 
liable 
to 
confusion.
καὶ 
Μόσοχ] 
Heb. 
‘that

s 
rendering 
is 
not 
unnatural, 
as 
‘Meshech,’ 
differing 
in 
consonants 
only 
by 
from 
‘drawers,‘ 
is 
regularly 
found 
associated 
with 
Tubal, 
Gen. 
x. 2, 
Ezek. 
xxvii. 13,

in 
Ezek.

violent. 
Jeremiah,

(xxvi.) 9, 
has 
a 
similar

applied 
to

Prof. 
Margoliouth

curious 
in

It 
is 
a 
question 
how 
far 
Delitzsch 
is 
calling 
in 
calling 
them 
the 
‘primitive 
stock.’ 
Asiatic 
lonians 
would 
be 
those 
most 
nearly 
concerned 
with 
the 
East:  
 but 
on 
the 
passage 
in 
Homer, 
Dr 
Leaf 
(Companion 
to 
Iliad, 
p. 238) 
says, 
“It 
will 
be 
seen 
that 
the 
lonians 
here 
meant 
cannot 
possibly 
be 
those 
of 
Asia 
Minor, 
to 
whom 
the 
name 
was 
afterwards 
specially 
given. 
The 
title 
must 
here 
be 
a 
general 
one, 
including 
the 
Lokrians, 
Phthians, 
Epeians, 
and, 
of 
course, 
the 
Athenians.” 
On 
the 
hand, 
his 
view 
(p. 6) 
is, 
that 
“the 
Ionians 
were 
the 
old 
preHellenic 
or 
Pelasgian 
population 
Hellenised 
by 
the 
Achaeans.’

Cf.

λαμπήνη

and 
the 
same 
idea 
is 
carried 
on 
in

probably

Scholz'

note, 
that

is 
not 
very 
convincing.

the 
received 
Heb.

has 
the 
prepos. 
but 
no 
copula. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
Greek

Latin 
might 
have 
inserted

Latin

not

the

use 
of 
πρὸς, 
according 
to 
’s 
text, 
is 
difficult 
Perhaps 
it 
IS 
akin 
to 
that 
in 
John 
i. 1, 2, 1 
John 
i. 2 
(where 
see 
Bp 
Westcott'

ix. 5. 
For 
the 
construction 
θελήσουσιν

cf. 
Luke

Ecclus.

The 
latter, 
especially, 
seems 
to 
support 
the 
alternative 
rendering 
in 
the 
note, 
Vol. 
I. 
p. 
x. 14.

seems 
due 
to 
reading 
‘Ι

‘I

Is 
any 
light 
thrown 
on 
the

In 
some, 
at 
any 
rate, 
of 
its 
compounds, 
σβεννύναι 
is 
used 
in 
senses 
rather 
different 
from 
the 
quenching 
of 
fire: 
see 
Aeschylus, 
Agata. 887,

of

have

the

In

Many

support 
the 
emendation 
‘rule’ ( 
‘tramplings,’ 
Cheyne) 
for 
‘pursuit.’ 
See 
notes 
in 
various 
commentaries, 
esp. 
Cheyne, 
Skinner, 
Alexander. 
I 
doubt 
whether 
’s

can 
be 
fairly 
quoted 
in 
support 
of 
this, 
their 
rendering 
being 
hardly 
exact 
in 
any 
case. 
They 
do 
not 
support 
the 
converse 
change 
of

To 
the

on

it

be 
added 
that

and 
in

xxiii. 7. 
παραδοθῆναι. 
The 
various 
uses 
of 
this 
word 
in 
the 
Greek 
Isaiah 
almost 
defy 
explanation. 
Here 
possibly 
was 
misread, 
and 
some 
of 
its 
letters 
mistaken 
for 
παραδοῦναι, 
I 
Chr.

xxx. 11. 
If 
τὸ 
λόγιον 
is 
a 
corruption 
of 
τὸν 
ἅγιον, 
the 
converse 
appears 
in 
Ps. 
cxxxviii. 2, 
where 
Mozley 
points 
out 
that 
τὸ 
ἅγιόν 
σου 
corresponds 
to 
‘thy 
word’ ( 
λόγιον 
often=
xxxii. 6.

due 
to 
reading 
for 
‘will

xxxiii. 23. 
The 
word 
‘prey,’ 
here 
taken 
by 
LXX. 
as 
‘until,’ 
has 
caused 
confusion 
elsewhere. 
In 
Numb. 
xxiii. 24 
it 
is 
rightly 
rendered, 
οὐ 
κοιμηθήσεται 
ἕως 
φάγῃ 
θήραν. 
But 
in 
Gen. 
xlix. 27, 
in 
the 
morning 
he 
shall 
devour 
the 
prey’ 
appears 
as 
τὸ 
πρωινὸν 
ἔδεται 
ἔτι 
(i.
e. 
Zeph. 
iii. 8, 
for ‘ 
until 
the

that 
I

has 
εἷς

(i.

some 
support. 
Other 
cases 
of 
confusion 
are:

‘α

Amos

‘perpetually’ 
εἷς 
μαρτύριον, 
and 
so 
Micah

 Prov.

 Vulg. 
is 
more 
generally 
right 
(ultra 
in 
Amos 
and 
Micah), 
but 
has 
in

in 
Zephaniah.
xli. 11. 
For 
ἀντίδικος 
cf.

The 
difficulty 
of 
εἰ 
μήν, 
which 
is 
somewhat 
hastily 
dismissed 
in 
my 
note, 
is 
that 
if 
‘if,’ 
the 
meaning 
of 
the 
clause 
is 
the 
opposite 
of 
what 
is 
wanted, 
and 
of 
what 
is 
given 
by 
εἰ 
μὴ 
or 
ἦ 
μήν. 
Moreover, 
μὴν 
does 
not 
seem 
to 
be 
used 
with 
εἰ 
conditional 
(or 
interrogative) 
in 
classical 
authors 
or 
in 
Ν.
T. 
The 
MSS. 
often 
show 
disagreement. 
The 
latest 
view 
is 
to 
consider 
εἷ 
μὴν 
a 
variety 
of 
ἦ 
μὴν; 
Blass, 
in 
his 
N.
T. 
Grammar 
(Mr 
’s 
translation) 
prints 
εἴ 
μήν, 
and 
so 
does 
Prof. 
Moulton, 
whose 
words 
(p. 46) 
are: 
“The 
complete 
establishment 
of 
εἴ 
μὴν 
by 
the 
papyri 
is 
an 
interesting 
confirmation 
of 
the 
best 
uncials. 
Despite 
Hort 
(p. 151) 
we 
must 
make 
the 
difference 
between 
εἶ 
μήν 
and 
ἦ 
μήν 
strictly 
orthographical 
after 
all, 
if 
the 
alternative 
is 
to 
suppose 
any 
connection 
with 
εἰ, 
if.” 
I 
should. 
upon 
this 
view, 
which 
almost 
certainly 
the 
right 
one, 
have 
said 
that 
εἷ 
μὴν 
“is 
hardly 
possible’  
 (ampt 
as 
an 
equivalent 
to 
ἦ 
μήν: 
and 
this, 
as 
written 
in 
the 
days 
of 
our 
Mss. 
or 
their 
predecessors, 
and 
almost 
back 
to 
the 
days 
of 
the 
Alexandrian 
translators, 
it 
apparently 
was.
hii. 5. 
Α 
reads 
ἐμαλακίσθη, 
but 
on 
general 
principles 
the 
reading 
of 
the 
great 
body 
of 
MSS., 
μεμαλάκισται, 
must 
be 
preferred. 
We 
then 
have 
a 
perf. 
and 
an 
aorist 
in 
parallel 
clauses. 
Above, 
in 
ver. 2, 
there 
are 
ἔστιν 
and 
εἶχον, 
then 
the 
perf. 
ἀπέστραπται 
(Cf. 
Josh. 
v. 5, 
ἀνέστραπται), 
two 
presents 
in 
ver. 4, 
and 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
surrounding 
verbs 
are 
aorists. 
The 
parallel 
aorist 
and 
perfect 
can 
also 
be 
seen 
at 
x. 7 
ἐνεθυμήθη...
λ.
ελόγισται, 
where 
possibly 
each 
tense 
has 
something 
of 
its 
own 
force, 
but 
contrast 
ἐλογίσθησαν, 
ν. 28, 
Χλ. [7; 
xxi. 9, 
πέπτωκεν...

In

or 
causal 
connecting 
particles,

cf.

On 
this 
subject 
see 
Moulton, 
N.
T. 
Grammar, 
Vol. 1. 
pp. 140146 
Mozley, 
Psalter 
of 
the 
Church, 
p. 148. 
I 
return 
to 
the 
subject 
below, 
Grammatical 
Note, § 6; 
meantime 
I 
venture 
on 
the 
provisional 
opinion 
that, 
where 
each 
tense 
has 
not 
its 
own 
proper 
force, 
some 
approximation 
or 
overlapping 
takes 
place: 
the 
perfect 
approaching 
the 
aorist 
in 
meaning, 
but 
that 
aorist 
itself 
having 
in 
the 
Lxx. 
a 
somewhat 
extended 
force, 
which 
renders 
the 
approach 
easier. 
In 
x. 7, 
λελόγισται 
might 
be 
passive 
and 
impersonal 
(l 
have 
not 
however 
translated 
it 
so) 
which 
seems 
to 
help 
the 
proper 
sense 
of 
the 
perfect.
lvii. 15, 16. 
It 
seems 
to 
me 
(and 
l 
have 
endeavoured 
to 
punctuate 
so 
as 
to 
make 
this 
sense 
not 
impossible) 
that 
here, 
according 
to 
the 
won, 
the 
meaning 
is 
somewhat 
like 
Exod. 
xxxiii. 19, 
xxxiv. 5-7, 
Lord 
proclaiming 
His 
own 
attributes, 
and 
His 
words 
beginning 
at 
Ἄγιος 
ἐν 
ἁγίοις, 
or 
even 
at 
ὁ 
ἐν 
ὑψηλοῖς.
lxiii. 8, 9. 
The 
punctuation 
might 
here 
be 
made 
to 
agree 
with 
Heb., 
beginning 
a 
fresh 
sentence 
with 
ἐκ 
πάσης 
θλίψεως. 
Various 
other 
passages 
might 
be 
brought 
by 
similar 
means 
to 
show 
less 
discrepancy: 
e.
g. 
iii. 17, 18, 
xxii. 24, 25, 
and 
possibly 
xxxiv. 9, 10, 
lvi. 7, 8, 
lx. 5, 6. 
But 
xxvi. 18, 
hi. 6, 7, 
would 
need 
alteration 
of 
text: 
lxiii. 2, 3 
probably 
requires 
a 
different 
division 
from 
the 
Heb.; 
and 
i. 11—13, 
xxvi. 8 
xxviii. 27, 28, 
xxix. 5, 6, 
xxxii. 13, 14, 
and 
lix. 17, 18, 
seem 
to 
defy 
this 
treatment.

ADDITIONAL 
NOTE 
ON 
THE 
GRAMMAR 
AND 
STYLE 
OF 
THE 
LXX.
There 
is 
not 
yet, 
so 
far 
as 
I 
know, 
any 
work 
in 
English 
which 
deals 
mainly 
and 
directly 
with 
the 
grammar 
and 
style 
of 
the 
Greek 
O.
T. 
The 
student 
has 
still 
to 
depend 
principally 
upon 
such 
books 
as 
deal 
with 
Hellenistic 
Greek 
generally, 
and 
with 
the 
lexicology 
and 
grammar 
of 
the 
N 
.T. 
Beside 
Janaaris' 
Historical 
Greek 
Grammar, 
whose 
range 
is 
too 
wide 
for 
our 
immediate 
purpose, 
and 
the 
N.
T. 
Grammars, 
whose 
period 
does 
not 
coincide, 
we 
can 
now 
turn 
to 
a 
chapter 
in 
Prof. 
’s 
Introduction 
to 
to 
O.
T. 
in 
Greek 
(Part 
I 
l. 
chap. 
IV.) ; 
very 
valuable 
so 
far 
as 
it 
goes, 
but 
reduced 
by 
the 
necessities 
of 
space 
and 
proportion 
to 
an 
outline 
sketch. 
Selections 
from 
tlze 
Septuagint, 
by 
F. 
C. 
Conybeare 
and 
St 
G. 
Stock, 
contains 
a 
short 
practical 
survey 
of 
the 
grammar, 
which 
will 
meet 
some 
but 
hardly 
all 
the 
’s 
needs. 
When 
a 
grammar 
of 
the 
LXX. 
does 
appear 
it 
will 
necessarily 
deal, 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
completeness, 
with 
many 
points 
which 
are 
interesting, 
especially 
for 
the 
light 
thrown 
upon 
philology, 
comparative 
and 
historical; 
but 
are 
not 
immediately 
important 
to 
readers 
Whose 
desire 
is 
to 
use 
the 
Greek 
version 
continuously. 
To 
these, 
the 
actual 
occurrence 
of 
a 
form 
or 
construction, 
however 
unclassical, 
is 
its 
own 
explanation 
in 
practice, 
provided 
that 
they 
can 
grasp 
its 
meaning. 
As 
a 
rule, 
the 
most 
pressing 
question 
is 
whether 
a 
doubtful 
sentence 
in 
the 
Greek 
is 
to 
be 
interpreted 
by 
the 
guidance 
of 
the 
Hebrew, 
or 
by 
the 
ascertained 
rules 
and 
practice 
of 
Greek, 
classical 
or 
Hellenistic. 
To 
decide 
this, 
either 
every 
such 
sentence 
must 
be 
noticed, 
or 
very 
carefully 
reasoned 
principles 
must 
be 
collected 
and 
laid 
down. 
Neither 
of 
these 
things 
can 
be 
done 
here, 
nor 
can 
even 
an 
outline 
be 
attempted. 
Only 
a 
few 
roughly 
assorted 
remarks 
can 
be 
put 
together.
Many 
points, 
both 
of 
accidence 
and 
syntax, 
can 
but 
be 
registered; 
they 
will 
hardly 
perplex 
the 
reader, 
or, 
if 
they 
should, 
he 
must 
turn 
for 
guidance 
to 
a 
translation—
the 
Revised 
represents 
standard 
opinions 
on 
many 
points—
unless 
he 
can 
find  
 he 
wants 
in 
Liddell 
and 
Scott, 
Prof. 
Sophocles' 
Lexicon 
of 
Byzantine 
Creek, 
or 
the 
N.
T. 
lexicons 
and 
grammars. 
In 
any 
case, 
no 
trouble 
need 
be 
caused 
by 
varieties 
of 
form: 
such 
as 
εὐθὴς 
for 
εὐθύς, 
τρανὸς 
for 
τρανὴς, 
σωτήριον, 
ὅρκος, 
δυσίν 
(which 
serves 
to 
mark 
the 
death 
Of 
the 
Dual), 
may, 
λήμψεται, 
ἐλάβοσαν, 
and 
the 
like: 
πλοῦτος 
neuter, 
the 
plurals 
of 
οἱρανὸς 
(as 
xxxiv. 11, 
xliv. 23) 
and 
γῆ 
(as 2 
Kings 
xviii. 35 
xix. 11, 
Ps. 
xlix. 11): 
τοίνυν 
fist 
in 
the 
clause 
(iii. 
to, 
v. 13, 
xxvii. 4 
xxxiii. 23), 
ἐὰν 
for 
ἂν 
after 
relatives: 
tenseforms 
such 
as 
φάγομα 
(xxix. 1), 
with 
φάγεσαι 
(lit. 16), 
ἐκέκραξα 
(see 
on 
vi. 2), 
’w’
yxataav 
(lxvi. 20), 
and 
even 
εἰλημμένος. 
xi. 5: 
κύκλῳ 
used 
almost 
as 
a 
preposition, 
vi. 2, 
ix. 18, 
εἰ 
and 
μὴ 
as 
interrogative 
particles, 
the 
latter 
extended 
by 
comparison 
with 
’s 
Greek, 
while 
ποῖος 
interrogative 
(l. 1 
c.) 
scarcely 
goes 
beyond 
it: 
ὃς 
for 
ὅστις, 
as 
xlii. 23; 
πῶς 
exclamatory, 
as 
xiv. 4, 2 
Sam. 
i. 19, 25, 27, 
Ezek. 
xxvi. 17, 
Lam. 
i. 1, 
with 
which 
compare 
Gen. 
xxviii. 17, 
Numb. 
xxiv. 5, 
Ps. 
lxxxiii. 1, 
cxix. 97 
where 
the 
more 
classical 
ὡς 
appears.
The 
article 
is 
generally 
used 
very 
much 
as 
in 
Attic: 
its 
omission 
before 
βασιλεὺς 
Ἀσσυρίων, 
vii. 20, 
xxxvi. 15, 
c. 
might 
seem 
anaIOgous 
to 
that 
of 
βασιλεὺς 
alone 
for 
the 
Persian 
king, 
in 
Herodotus 
(v. 1, 
ἃς.) 
and 
Thucydides (1. 18, 
c.): 
but 
it 
is 
also 
omitted 
in 
the 
case 
e.
g. 
of 
Ahab 
and 
Benhadad 
in 1 
Kings 
xxi. 
The 
tendency 
seems 
to 
be 
decidedly 
towards 
omission; 
before 
nominatives 
used 
as 
vocatives, 
as 
i. 
to, 
and 
occasionally 
with 
the 
subject, 
as 
i. 21, 
though 
this 
is 
more 
generally 
retained, 
as 
ix. 7, 
xi. 10, 
cf. 
xiv. 26; 
and 
particularly 
before 
participles, 
as, 
apparently, 
in 
viii. 14, 
xxvi. 2, 3, 
xxx. 17 
xxxiii. 15 : 
sometimes 
these 
participles 
have 
ἄνθρωπος 
in 
sing. 
or 
plur., 
as 
viii. 15, 
xxv. 3; 
contrast 
xxxii. 2. 
On 
its 
use 
with 
οὗτος 
and 
ὅδε 
see 
below, 5. 
Other 
loosenesses 
may 
be 
noticed 
at 
v. 21, 
xxix. 20. 
The 
article 
is 
often 
repeated 
in 
such 
arrangements 
as 
τὰ 
βδελύγματα 
αὐτοῦ 
τὰ 
ἀργυρᾶ 
καὶ 
τὰ 
χρυσᾶ, 
ii. 20, 
cf. 
iii. 22, 
ν. 15, 16, 
xxviii. 1, 4, 
c.; 
but 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
phrases 
like 
ὁ 
τοῦ 
θεοῦ 
οἶκος, 
oi 
ἐν 
Σαμαρείᾳ 
ἐγκαθήμενοι, 
are 
rarely 
found 
(though 
see 
ix. 14, 
lix. 21); 
cf. 
ii. 2, 
ix. 9, 
but 
almost 
any 
page 
will 
show 
instances.
Nouns 
need 
cause 
little 
difficulty, 
apart 
from 
forms, 
spellings, 
and 
vocabulary. 
The 
neuter 
plural 
is 
constantly 
used 
with 
a 
plural 
verb, 
as 
well 
as 
with 
the 
singular, 
with 
seeming 
indifference: 
the 
MSS. 
very 
often 
vary. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
xviii. 2, 3 
contains 
what 
may 
be 
suspected 
to 
be 
a 
case 
of 
the 
Schema 
’ndarz’
cum, 
and, 
if 
so, 
a 
very 
strong 
one: 
cf. 
Moulton, 
Grammar 
of 
N.
T. 
Greek, 
p. 58. 
Here 
we 
may 
note 
the 
accusative 
of 
respect, 
still 
in 
force, 
as 
in 
xi. 15, 
xxxvi. 22 
and 
the 
accus. 
with 
a 
passive 
verb, 
xxxvii. 2. 
We 
may 
wonder 
whether  
 the 
accusative 
can 
possibly 
be 
used 
instead 
of 
a 
genitive, 
x. 32, 
and 
in 
apposition 
to 
a 
genitive 
(indeclinable) 
in 
xxxvii. 38! 
Both 
passages 
can 
be 
construed 
as 
they 
stand, 
but 
still 
the 
doubt 
occurs. 
On 
ὃν 
τρόπον, 
used 
commonly 
as 
a 
conjunction, 
see 
on 
vii. 2. 
τοῦτον 
τρόπον 
is 
found 
in 
Attic, 
but 
less 
commonly 
than 
the 
dative.
Adjectives, 
being 
relatively 
scarce 
in 
Heb., 
are 
not 
very 
common 
in 
the 
LXX.'
s 
somewhat 
literal 
rendering. 
The 
indeclinable 
πλήρης 
most 
probably 
to 
be 
found 
in 
lxiii. 2, 
where 
see 
note.
Pronouns 
decidedly 
show 
some 
blunting 
of 
the 
classical 
usage. 
Ἀὐτὸς 
in 
oblique 
cases 
is 
excessively 
frequent 
as 
3rd 
pers. 
pronoun, 
and 
this, 
corresponding 
to 
mere 
suffixes 
in 
Heb., 
has 
often 
been 
noticed 
as 
a 
disfigurement 
of 
the 
LXX.'
s 
style. 
Even 
in 
the 
nominative, 
the 
emphatic 
force 
is 
sometimes 
hard 
to 
perceive, 
e.
g. 
i. 2 
xxxiv. 17, 
xlii. 17; 
xxxi. 2 
seems 
more 
pointed, 
and 
lxiii. 9, 10 
difficult 
to 
determine. 
Ὅδε 
and 
its 
compounds 
have 
nearly 
retired 
in 
favour 
of 
οὗτος, 
and 
the 
distinction 
between 
them 
is 
blurred: 
the 
phrase 
τάδε 
λέγει... 
is 
common, 
and 
not 
to 
be 
distinguished 
from 
οὕτως 
λέγει 
(or 
εἶπεν) 
in 
meaning, 
though 
Mr 
H. 
St 
J. 
Thackeray 
detects 
by 
its 
use 
a 
different 
’s 
hand 
in 
Jeremiah 
(journal 
of 
Theol. 
Studies, 
Jan. 1903). 
A 
few 
instances 
of 
ὅδε 
occur 
in 
the 
Pentateuch, 
as 
Numb. 
xvi. 42, 
Gen. 
xliii. 21, 
where 
it 
is 
used 
with 
the 
article, 
as 
οὗτος 
is, 
e.
g. 
in 
xxv. 7, 
xxvi. 1. 
The 
article 
is 
also 
regularly 
used 
with 
ἐκεῖνος· 
in 
the 
phrase 
ἐν 
τῇ 
ἡμέρᾳ 
ἐκείνῃ, 
ii. 20, 
ἃς. 
The 
demonstrative 
usually 
stands 
last 
in 
these 
cases, 
contrast 
ix. 14, 15, 
xiv. 26. 
Ὅδε 
occurs 
in 
Isaiah 
at 
any 
rate 
once, 
lx. 8; 
also 
Jerem. 
xlviii. 
Xlviii. 33, 
xxv. 
3c 
(xxxii. 16). 
Τοιοῦτος 
occurs, 
lviii. 6, 
lxvi. 8: 
probably 
it 
was 
not 
often 
needed.
The 
verbs 
show 
many 
nonAttic 
forms. 
The 
3rd 
pers. 
pl. 
in 
σαν 
meets 
us 
frequently 
in 
second 
aorists, 
and 
sometimes 
in 
optatives, 
such 
as 
ἐνέγκαισαν, 
lxvi. 20, 
already 
mentioned 
(cf. 
Moulton, 
Ν.
Τ. 
Grammar, 
p. 33): 
also 
an 
occasional 
perfect 
3rd 
pl. 
in 
καν, 
as 
v. 29 
B. 
Εἶπα 
is 
common 
(εἶπαν 
in 
Ii. 23); 
ἐλθάτω 
in 
v. 
19B, 
xxvi. 2 
NA. 
The 
second 
perfect 
πέποιθα 
has 
imperat. 
2nd 
pl. 
in 
ατε, 
l. 10; 
cf. 
Jerem.

Ps. 
cxlvi. 3, 
and

On 
the 
use 
of 
the 
tenses 
generally. 
see 
Vol. 1., 
Introduction, 
“Or. 
Methods 
of 
Rendering.” 
The 
aorist 
seems 
to 
be 
used 
with 
full 
of 
meaning; 
there 
are 
comparatively 
few 
cases 
in 
which 
the 
‘gnomic’ 
use, 
with 
those 
of 
the 
‘immediate 
past’ 
and 
‘indefinite 
cannot 
be 
made 
to 
cover 
the 
ground; 
but 
sometimes 
even 
a 
liberal 
use 
of 
these 
explanations 
hardly 
satisties 
Leaving 
aside 
the 
question 
how 
best 
to 
render 
into 
English, 
such 
tenses 
as 
εἶδον, 
vi. 5; 
κατίσχυσεν,  
 xxiv. 20; 
ἐπένθησεν, 
xxxiii. 9; 
ἀπέστησαν, 
xxxiii. 14: 
ὑψώθη, 
lii. 8 
ελάλησεν, 
lix. 3; 
εὗρεν, 
lix. 4; 
ἔγνω, 
lxiii. 16, 
present 
difficulties 
which 
are 
seldom 
felt 
in 
reading 
the 
classical 
Attic 
authors. 
Many 
other 
aorists 
are 
found 
which, 
though 
not 
in 
themselves 
impossible, 
are 
difficult 
in 
consideration 
of 
their 
context 
and 
probable 
meaning.
In 
Isaiah, 
the 
future 
causes 
little 
difficulty: 
it 
may 
have 
sometimes 
been 
wrongly 
chosen 
by 
the 
translator, 
but 
his 
intention 
is 
seldom 
doubtful. 
ln 
clauses 
after 
ὃν 
τρόπον 
it 
is, 
however, 
awkward. 
The 
idea 
seems 
not 
so 
much 
to 
represent 
the 
Heb. 
imperf., 
which 
is 
not 
always 
found 
in 
the 
original, 
as 
to 
assimilate 
the 
tense 
to 
the 
corresponding 
clause.
Most 
instances 
of 
the 
perfect 
in 
lsaiah 
are 
natural 
enough; 
and 
the 
tense 
is 
fairly 
common: 
but 
see 
above 
on 
liii. 5 
for 
cases 
where 
it 
occurs 
in 
parallel 
clauses 
with 
the 
aorist. 
From 
Prof. 
Moulton'
s 
discussion 
of 
the 
matter 
(Grammar 
of 
N.
T. 
Greek, 
p. 140 
foll.) 
we 
see 
that 
the 
best 
modern 
authorities 
are 
inclined 
to 
recognize 
the 
possibility 
of 
the 
aoristic 
use 
of 
the 
perfect 
in 
some 
N.
T. 
writers, 
accepting 
them, 
however, 
with 
extreme 
caution. 
Prof. 
Moulton 
himself 
limits 
them, 
apparently, 
to 
a 
few 
in 
Revelation, 
and 
three 
instances 
of 
ἔσχηκα, 
as 
a 
special 
form, 
in 
’s 
Epistles. 
This 
ἔσχηκα, 
with 
ἀπέσταλκα—
for 
which 
see 
Acts 
vii. 35, 2 
Cor. 
xii. 17, 
Exod. 
iii. 13—15, 
lsai. 
certain 
forms 
not 
simply 
reduplicated, 
to 
which 
Mozley 
(p. 148) 
draws 
attention, 
are 
suSpected 
of 
aoristic 
force. 
Mozley 
also 
points 
out 
the 
use 
of 
the 
perf. 
in 
titles 
of 
Pss. 
xciiii., 
xcvi., 
after 
ὅτε, 
and 
a 
few 
others, 
such 
as 
B'
s 
εἴρηκε 
in 2 
Kings 
vi. 7. 
ὁπότε 
and 
ἡνίκα, 
rather 
than 
ὅτε, 
seem 
to 
be 
used 
in 
titles 
of 
Psalms 
with 
unmistakable 
aorists: 
cf. 
in 
Isaiah, 
xvi. 13, 
xx. 1, 
xxxviii. 9; 
but 
this 
is 
not 
invariable, 
see 
lxiii. 
As 
to 
aoristic 
perfects 
in 
the 
LXX., 
we 
have 
to 
remember 
ﬁrst, 
that 
the 
translation 
Is 
not 
homogeneous: 
and 
Prof. 
Moulton 
says 
(p. 143), 
“We 
are 
entirely 
at 
liberty 
to 
recognise 
such 
perfects 
in 
one 
writer 
and 
deny 
them 
to 
another, 
or 
to 
allow 
them 
for 
certain 
verbs 
and 
negative 
the 
class 
as 
a 
whole.” 
Secondly, 
the 
question 
may 
be 
whether 
it 
is 
the 
form 
of 
the 
one 
tense 
or 
the 
meaning 
of 
the 
other 
that 
prevailed; 
or 
rather, 
whether 
it 
was 
not 
made 
easier 
for 
the 
perfect 
to 
be 
used 
where 
we 
might 
have 
expected 
an 
aorist, 
by 
the 
aorist 
having 
already 
extended 
its 
limits, 
so 
as 
almost 
to 
encroach 
upon 
what 
was 
the 
territory 
of 
the 
perfect. 
(The 
perfect 
form, 
that 
is, 
is 
perhaps 
regaining 
for 
the 
tense 
some 
of 
the 
ground 
which 
the 
aorist 
had 
previously 
extended 
its 
meaning 
to 
cover.) 
On 
the 
coupling 
of 
the 
two, 
as 
in 
liii. 5, 
we 
may 
again 
quote 
Prof. 
Moulton, 
speaking 
(p. 143) 
of 
“aorist 
and 
perfect 
joined 
with 
καί 
and 
with 
identical 
subject.  
 When 
the 
nexus 
is 
so 
close, 
we 
might 
fairly 
suppose 
it 
possible 
for 
the 
tenses 
to 
be 
contaminated 
by 
the 
association, 
even 
where 
a 
perfect 
would 
not 
have 
been 
used 
aoristically 
by 
itself.” 
Hence 
no 
surprise 
need 
be 
felt 
at 
the 
coordinate 
aor. 
and 
perf. 
in 
our 
Isaiah 
passages, 
while 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
there 
seems 
to 
be 
no 
instance 
of 
an 
isolated 
aorist 
perfect 
in 
the 
book. 
There 
are, 
it 
is 
true, 
some 
where 
the 
aorist, 
according 
to 
some 
of 
its 
uses 
in 
the 
book, 
would 
appear 
equally 
possible. 
Compare 
e.
g. 
ἤκουσεν, 
vai. 8, 
with 
ἀκηκόασιν 
below, 
ver. 19, 
or 
ἠρήμωται, 
i. 7, 
with 
ἠρημώθη, 
xxiv. 10; 
also 
xlvii. 13 
with 
lvii. 
IO. 
According 
to 
my 
view, 
as 
expressed 
in 
Vol. 
I. “ 
On 
Methods 
of 
Rendering,” 
the 
extended 
use 
of 
the 
aorist 
in 
Isaiah 
is 
largely 
to 
its 
being 
the ’ 
choice 
as 
the 
normal 
tense 
to 
represent 
the 
Heb. 
perfect. 
The 
rest 
of 
the 
prophetic, 
lyric, 
and 
poetic 
passages 
of 
the 
Ο.
Τ. 
are, 
so 
far 
as 
I 
can 
see, 
not 
unlike 
Isaiah 
in 
this 
respect. 
Plain 
narrative, 
introducing 
the 
help 
of 
a 
continuous 
story 
or 
context, 
stands 
on 
a 
different 
footing.
The 
rendering 
of 
the 
LXX. 
into 
English 
has 
of 
course 
difficulties 
of 
its 
own, 
of 
which 
these 
tenses 
form 
not 
the 
least 
important. 
The 
English 
translator 
has 
to 
determine 
what 
the 
Greek 
translator 
meant, 
and 
to 
judge 
(see § 1) 
how 
far 
to 
render 
in 
the 
light 
of 
the 
original, 
and 
how 
far 
by 
the 
ordinary 
rules 
of 
the 
Greek 
language. 
As 
a 
hostage 
has 
been 
given 
to 
fortune 
in 
Vol. 1., 
no 
more 
need 
be 
said 
here. 
But 
on 
the 
question 
of 
the 
aorist 
and 
perfect 
especiallynit 
must 
be 
remembered 
that 
the 
use 
of 
tenses 
is 
not 
a 
fixed 
quantity, 
either 
as 
between 
two 
languages 
(though 
with 
obviously 
corresponding 
forms) 
or 
between 
two 
stages 
of 
one 
language. 
The 
English 
tenses 
themselves 
have 
undergone 
much 
change 
in 
usage. 
Again, 
the 
French 
past 
tense 
with 
avoir 
(I 
avoid 
the 
terms 
‘definite’ 
and 
‘indefinite’) 
corresponds, 
evidently, 
in 
form 
to 
the 
English 
tense 
with 
‘have,’ 
and 
jaimai 
on 
the 
whole 
to 
I 
loved; 
but 
the 
usage 
often 
differs 
considerably. 
I 
choose, 
almost 
at 
random, 
a 
quotation 
from 
MM. 
ErckhmannChatrian'
s 
Waterloo, 
chap. 
ix.: 
Cette 
montre...
je 
Lai 
regue 
du 
prince 
ène 
pour 
une 
action
éclat.’
 And 
one 
from 
Racine 
(Athalie, 
Act 
II. 
Sc. 
V. 
l. 511 
foll.) 
“Mais 
lorsque 
revenant 
de 
mon 
trouble 
funeste
J'
admirais 
sa 
douceur, 
son 
air 
noble 
et 
modeste,
Ƒai 
senti 
tout 
à 
coup 
un 
homicide 
acier.’
Could 
an 
Englishman 
possibly 
use 
the 
tense 
I 
have... 
in 
sentences 
such 
as 
either 
of 
these? 
We 
must 
therefore 
be 
prepared 
to 
ﬁnd 
even  
 the 
Greek 
aorist 
and 
perfect 
occasionally 
approximating 
in 
their 
meanings, 
and 
frequently, 
at 
one 
or 
another 
stage

The 
participles 
are 
for 
the 
most 
part 
ordinary: 
the 
active 
perf. 
participle 
(in 
form) 
occurs 
roughly 
speaking 
about 
forty 
times 
in 
Isaiah; 
but 
of 
these 
more 
than 
half 
are 
instances 
of 
πεποιθώς, 
which 
is 
frequently 
used 
with 
tenses 
of 
εἰμὶ 
to 
form 
equivalents 
for 
finite 
forms. 
ἰσχυκότες, 
viii. 9, 
is 
unexpected 
and 
may 
be 
considered 
awkward, 
but 
cannot 
be 
fairly 
called 
irregular. 
Apart 
from 
πέποιθα, 
βεβούλευμαι 
(iii. 9, 
xiv. 24., 26, 27, 
xlvi. 10, 11) 
and 
πέπαυται 
(xxiv. 8, 
xxvi. 
to, 
xxxii. 
to, 
xxxiii. 8) 
are 
the 
commonest 
ﬁnite 
perfects; 
the 
required 
meaning, 
of 
course, 
accounting 
for 
this.
τοῦ 
with 
infin. 
mostly 
stands 
for 
Heb. 
with 
infin.; 
very 
occasionally 
for 
D 
with 
infin. 
(privativc 
sense), 
which 
is 
oftener 
τοῦ 
μή. 
Notice 
the 
doubt 
as 
to 
the 
insertion 
of 
μὴ 
in 
viii. 16, 
xxv. 2 
(Heb. 
and 
with 
nouns), 
and 
the 
variant 
τὸ 
with 
infin., 
apparently 
consecutive, 
in 
xxi. 
(In 
the 
phrases 
Ζῶ 
ἐγώ, 
xlix. 18, 
ᾖ 
κύριος, 
the 
verb 
is 
indicative; 
the 
Latin 
is 
vivo

and 
this 
agrees 
with 
Heb.

Note 
the 
subj. 
following

and 
the 
optatives

On 
adverbs 
there 
is 
little 
to 
say. 
Prof. 
Moulton 
(p. 105) 
alludes 
to 
the 
N.
T. 
use 
of 
ἀνὰ 
and 
κατὰ 
distributively: 
Lxx. 
also 
use 
ἀνὰ 
with 
numerals, 
as 
l 
Kings 
xviii. 13, 
but 
these, 
being 
mostly 
indeclinables, 
give 
no 
clue 
to 
the 
case. 
The 
double 
adverbial 
phrase, 
ταχὺ 
κούφως 
ἔρχονται, 
ν. 26, 
is 
noticeably 
awkward.
Prepositions 
show 
more 
departure 
from 
classical 
standards. 
The 
niceties 
of 
Attic, 
as 
in 
other 
matters, 
are 
blurred. 
For 
instance, 
ἐπὶ 
τὸ 
ὅρος 
τοῦτο, 
XXV. 6, 
is 
much 
nearer 
in 
meaning 
to 
ἐπ’ 
ἄκρων 
τῶν 
ὀρέων, 
ii. 2, 
ἐπὶ 
κούφοις, 
xxx. 16, 
or 
the 
neighbouring 
ἐν 
τῷ 
ὄρει 
τούτῳ, 
xxv. 7, 
than 
to 
ἐπὶ 
τὸ 
ὅρος 
Σιών, 
xxix. 8 
(leaving 
xxxi. 5 
aside 
as 
ambiguous). 
Similarly 
πέποιθα 
is 
followed 
by 
ἐπὶ 
with 
acc. 
or 
with 
dat., 
and 
ἐν 
with 
dat., 
almost 
indifferently; 
see 
xxxi. 1, 
xxxii. 3 
xxxiii. 2, 
&amp;
c. 
Ἐν 
and 
εἷς 
seldom 
(if 
ever) 
show 
signs 
of 
but 
the 
former 
has 
extended 
its 
uses, 
in 
the 
endeavour 
to 
do 
the 
work 
of 
Heb. 
Ἀπὸ 
is 
inclined 
to 
encroach 
upon 
ὑπὸ, 
xiii. 19 
Β, 
and 
to 
lose 
its 
shade 
of 
difference 
from 
ἐκ 
on 
some 
occasions; 
but 
readings 
sometimes 
vary, 
as 
in 
viii. 19, 
cf. 
xxix. 4. 
The 
dat. 
is 
seldom 
found  
 after 
prepositions 
other 
than 
ἐν 
and 
ἐπί, 
though 
it 
might 
have 
seemed 
difficult 
to 
do 
without 
πρός 
(cf. 
Moulton, 
p. 104 
foll.). 
Prof. 
Moulton 
shows 
that 
in 
the 
N.
T. 
the 
dative 
would 
be 
the 
scarcest 
case 
after 
prepositions 
but 
for 
the 
predominant 
ἐν: 
in 
the 
Lxx. 
it 
might 
be 
said 
generally 
that 
certain 
uses 
of 
the 
dative 
are 
abundant, 
but 
the 
number 
of 
constructions 
in 
which 
the 
case 
is 
commonly 
used 
is 
smaller 
than 
in 
classical 
Greek.
Conjunctions 
and 
particles 
have 
somewhat 
shifted 
their 
force 
and 
proportion. 
ὅτι 
often 
represents 
Heb. 
and 
it 
is 
sometimes 
difficult 
to 
know 
whether 
it 
represents 
‘that’ 
or 
‘for’: 
μὲν 
and 
δέ, 
their 
regular 
antithesis, 
have 
all 
but 
disappeared; 
δέ 
alone 
is 
not 
very 
common, 
and 
μὲν 
occurs 
twice 
in 
the 
book, 
vi. 2, 
where 
δὲ 
following 
is 
doubtful, 
and 
xli. 7, 
where 
it 
is 
absent. 
On 
ὅτε, 
ὁπότε, 
ἡνίκα, 
see 
above, § 6. 
Relative 
particles 
or 
conjunctional 
phrases 
seem 
increasingly 
common: 
ἕως 
οὗ, 
ἀφ’ 
οὗ, 
with 
perf. 
xiv. 8, 
with 
aor. 
xliii. 4, 
διότι, 
ὃν 
τρόπον: 
cf. 
perhaps 
ἐφ’ 
ἅ(??), 
xxv. 
On 
εἷ 
μὴ 
ἤκουσας; 
xl. 28, 
see 
note 
there. 
It 
certainly 
seems 
simplest 
to 
take 
it 
as 
interrogative.
The 
apodosis 
is 
sometimes 
marked 
by 
καὶ, 
as 
in 
lviii. 13, 14, 
where 
it 
is 
uncertain 
which 
καὶ 
has 
this 
office; 
which 
perhaps 
comes 
from 
the 
use 
of 
Heb. 
though 
this 
is 
not 
found 
in 
either 
of 
these 
instances. 
I 
cannot 
recall 
an 
instance 
of 
δέ 
similarly 
used 
in 
the 
book, 
but 
its 
comparative 
rarity 
in 
any 
sense 
makes 
this 
not 
surprising.
ἀλλὰ 
and 
πρὶν 
are 
often 
followed 
by 
ἤ, 
MSS. 
varying 
much. 
The 
meaning 
is 
hardly 
affected, 
unless 
some 
slight 
emphasis 
is 
to 
be 
understood.
Οὐ 
and 
μὴ 
present 
no 
very 
marked 
peculiarities. 
Μὴ 
introducing 
a 
hesitating 
assertion 
or 
suggestion 
may 
possibly 
occur 
xxviii. 17, 
where 
see 
note. 
Οὐ 
may 
be 
seen 
used 
to 
negative 
a 
specitic 
phrase 
after 
ἵνα 
c. 
subj. 
in 
viii. 20, 
and 
cf. 
x. 15, 
where 
however 
the 
phrase 
οὐχ 
οὕτως 
is 
a 
special 
weakness 
of 
the 
Lxx. 
With 
participles 
οὐκ 
occurs, 
as 
in 
xli. 11, 12, 
lvi. 11, 
lix. 10; 
μή, 
less 
frequently 
than 
might 
be 
expected, 
as 
in 
xxix. 12.. 
In 
relative 
clauses, 
οὐκ, 
as 
in 
lxv. 20; 
μή, 
as 
in 
lviii. 
Interjections, 
as 
a 
matter 
of 
usage, 
differ 
from 
Attic. 
φεῦ 
and 
αἰαῖ 
are 
replaced 
generally 
by 
οὐαί, 
see 
on 
i. 24. 
Occasionally 
ὦ 
is 
used, 
as 
in 
Habak. 
ii. 9, 15, 2 
Kings 
vi. 5. 
See 
also 
such 
passages 
as 
Judg. 
xi. 35 
Jerem. 
xxii. 18, 
with 
their 
variants.
But 
the 
general 
colouring 
of 
the 
style 
remains 
the 
chief 
peculiarity 
of 
the 
LXX.'
s 
Greek. 
It 
is 
not 
so 
much 
that 
the 
constructions 
are 
unclassical, 
as 
that 
most 
classical 
arrangements 
are 
rare 
or  
 absent. 
Owing 
to 
the 
short 
coordinate 
sentences, 
which 
follow 
the 
original, 
the 
devices 
of 
Greek 
syntax 
have 
all 
but 
disappeared, 
while 
most 
of 
the 
methods 
of 
expression 
recur 
so 
frequently 
as 
to 
be 
bald 
and 
monotonous 
in 
any 
case, 
and, 
if 
not 
agreeable 
to 
classical 
usage, 
to 
have 
the 
appearance 
and 
effect 
of 
mannerisms. 
Thus 
the 
optative 
disappears 
in 
historic 
consecution, 
leaving 
its 
work 
to 
the 
subjunctive 
and 
indit 
ative, 
as 
in 
lvii. 8; 
it 
also 
grows 
rare 
after 
εἷ, 
and, 
when 
it 
is 
found, 
the 
potential 
clause 
does 
not 
match 
it; 
see 
xlix. 15, 
and 
cf. 
Moulton, 
p. 196. 
On 
the 
other 
hand 
it 
is 
used 
with 
excessive 
frequency 
to 
express 
Wishes, 
Job 
iii. 3—9, 
Ps. 
xx. 
10ù4, 
c.; 
e.
g. 
in 
PS. 
cix. 7—15. 
There 
are, 
again, 
instances 
of 
anacoluthon, 
beyond, 
or 
different 
from, 
the 
Attic 
practice, 
and 
probably 
mainly 
due 
to 
the 
almost 
caseless 
Hebrew 
of 
the 
original: 
cf. 
Vol. 
I. 
p. 40. 
Thus 
λέγων 
or 
λέγοντες 
is 
used 
to 
connect 
a 
’s 
statement 
with 
the 
narrative 
introducing 
it, 
though 
neither 
agreeing 
with 
the 
grammatical 
subject 
nor 
even 
referring 
to 
it: 
see, 
e.
g., 
I 
Kings 
i. 51, 
xviii. 1, 
in 
contrast 
to 
(Zen. 
xxxi. 1. 
Circumstances 
make 
this 
infrequent 
in 
Isaiah, 
though 
see 
vii. 2, 
with 
the 
variants. 
Other 
instances 
of 
looseness 
in 
the 
matter 
of 
cases 
may 
be 
seen 
at 
xvi. 6, 
xxviii. 1, 
xxxi. 1 
pOSSIbly, 
xxxii. 13, 
xxxiii. 20, 
ἃς. 
Α 
strange 
apposition, 
but 
of 
another 
kind, 
is 
that 
in 
vii. 17, 
ἡμέρας...
τὸν 
βασιλέα 
Ἀσσυρίων.
Special 
Hebraisms 
have 
been 
noted 
where 
they 
occur; 
their 
combination 
with 
the 
features 
here 
briefly 
mentioned, 
with 
the 
addition 
of 
a 
vocabulary 
and 
ideas 
not 
those 
of 
Attic 
Greek, 
produce 
a 
marked 
difference 
in 
general 
effect. 
The 
scope 
ofa 
remark 
made 
by 
Prof. 
Moulton 
(p. 76) 
might 
be 
extended: 
“The 
Greek 
translator, 
endeavouring 
to 
be 
as 
literal 
as 
he 
could, 
nevertheless 
took 
care 
to 
use 
Greek 
that 
was 
possible, 
however 
unidiomatic.” 
This, 
I 
‘he’ 
or 
‘they’ 
constantly 
did, 
both 
by 
choice 
and 
of 
necessity; 
thinking 
it 
the 
paramount 
duty 
to 
be 
literal, 
and 
not 
caring 
for 
the 
usages 
of 
literary 
Greek. 
But 
if 
they 
were 
not 
masters 
of 
Attic 
by 
inheritance 
or 
acquirement, 
neither 
were 
they 
devoid 
of 
native 
gift 
of 
language, 
nor 
of 
some 
conception 
of 
a 
’s 
duty, 
nor 
of 
skill 
to 
carry 
it 
out.
[The 
references 
are 
to 
chapters 
and 
verses 
of 
Isaiah: 
occasionally
