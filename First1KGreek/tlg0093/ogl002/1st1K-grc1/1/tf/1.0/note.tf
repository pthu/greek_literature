4579	footnote ¹ ἀντιμεθίστανται. ? ἀντιμεθίσταται. ² Plin. 5. 140. Of Matriketas nothing is knowD. ³ Said ”Plin. 2 31) to have first recognised the Ram and the Archer. Athen. (7. 278 b) connects him with Tenedos.
footnote ¹ τὸν ὑπογ. τρόπον seems to mean the same as the Aristote-lian τὸν ὑφηγημένον τρόπον, e.g. Eth. Nic. 2. 7. 9. The rendering ‘the following method’ would however suit the context.
footnote ¹ cf. 37. ² ὕδατος ins. Furl. ³ Plin. 18. 344. ⁴ Plin. 18. 356. 5 ὑετοῦ δὲ σημεῖα bracketed by Sch. 6 cf. Arist. Meteor. 3. 4; Plut. Quaest. Nat. 1. 2. 7 cf. 42. 8. i.e. breaks up into small ‘grains’) (?) cf. 25, 42, 54.
footnote ¹ Plin. 18. 364; Verg. Georg. 1. 375. ² ἐπιρροιζήσῃ. Sc. with his wings probably; not, as LS. ‘croaks.’ Plin. (18. 362) seems to have had a fuller text, or to have drawn also on some other authority. ³ ὑετῶν ὄντων can hardly mean ‘while it is raining.’
footnote ¹ Sch. cites Plin. 18. 364, vermes terreni erumpentes, as representing this, which seems doubtful. 2 cf. Plin. 18. 361; Cic. Div. 2. 70. ³ ἐὰν τῷ. ? ἐὰν ἐν τῷ.
footnote ¹ Evidently an Attic saying, of days when only the upper part of the Εuboean mountains was visible.
footnote ¹ So called also by Pind. Nem. 5. 19. Paus. 2. 30. 3 calls it the temple of Ζεῦς Πανελλήνιος. καὶ bracketed by Sch. 2 cf. C.P. 2. 2.
footnote ¹ Plin. 18. 343 suggests that this is the meaning: text perhaps defective. cf. Verg. Georg. 1. 445. 2 cf. 38. 3 Lit. ‘ the crescent moon has a northerly character.’ ἡ ἄνω add. Furl.
footnote ¹ cf. 40: Plin. 18. 359: Verg. Georg. 1. 356. 2 cf. Arist. Probl. 26. 12 ad fin. 3 ξηραίνει, ὑγραίνει seem to be used quasi-impersonally; but the text is perhaps defective. 4 νότια MSS.; βόρεια conj. Furl., surely with good reason. cf. Arist. Probl. 1. 24. 5 After δεξιὸν Sch. and W. mark a lacuna, which does not seem necessary. 6 cf. Arist. H.A. 9. 6 ad fin.
footnote ¹ κηλάδες, i.e. a ‘mackerel sky’ (?) The word seems to occur nowhere else except in Hesych., who renders ἄνυδρος: derivation obscure. It should probably be read in § 51 for κοιλάδες. ² Plin. 18. 354. ³ ἄν. Sc. εἶναι, which perhaps should be added.
footnote 1 cf. 22. 2 cf. 57. 3 cf. de Ventis 50; Arist Probl. 26. 3. 4 cf. 14, 25, 42, 54. 5 The ‘figure’ (giving points of the compass) has not been preserved. Arist. Meteor. 2. 6. describes such a figure (ὑπο-γραφή), which may be reconstructed thus :—
footnote ¹ Ι have bracketed ἢ βορέας as probably a gloss on ἀπαρκτίας; ἢ is difficult to account for otherwise. See diagram. ² Plin. 18. 360.
footnote ¹ i.e. and the succeeding day will be more or less stormy in proportion. ἀπολειφθείη ? ἀποληφθείη =‘may be obscured.’ ² cf. 27. i.e. it is possible, more or less, to see the whole circle.
footnote ¹ τευθίδες. The word is perhaps corrupt and conceals the name of a bird 2 cf. 21, 29. πολύπλοκον is Furlanus’ conj. for Vulg. πολύποδον. ³ πνεύμονες. Plin. 18. 359. pulmones: cf. 9. 154.
footnote ¹ ὄνου φάτνη. cf. 23, 51. See LS, s.ν. ὄνοs ; Theocr. 22. 21. Plin. 18. 353, sunt in signo Cancri duae stellae parvae
footnote ¹ Γυρῶν. γυροῦν W, Heraclides gives γυρεὸν, Plut. γυρεῦον; but one MS. of Plut. gives γύρων with a marginal gloss ‘sc. πετρῶν,’ which suggests that the word is a proper name. Od. 4. 500 mentions the Γὐραι (i.e. the ‘round-backed rocks’)
footnote ¹ τὸ add. Sch. ² cf. 45. 3 σπάλακα Vulg.; σπάκα Bas. Ald.; σκολόπακα (woodcock ?) conj. Furl. 4 i. e. (reading σκολόπακα) for the bird to find worms in with its long beak (Sch.). It is hard to say, without illus-
footnote ¹ κηλάδες I conj. cf. 31, to which this statement answers. κοιλάδες MSS. ² Plin. 18 356. Plin. 18. 357. cf. Verg. Georg. 1. 401. 4 Plin. 18. 401. ³ ἐν χειμῶν. ? ‘in winter.’ The same ambiguity occurs in many places: the sense seems fixed here by the next sentence.
footnote 1 cf. 41. ² cf. 14, 25, 42. 3 H. P. 7. 13. 6 the same is said of σκίλλα.
