6426	footnote ¹ i.e. there is not one set of terms applied to the varieties of ‘good’ and another distinct set applied to the varieties of ‘evil’ odours, but we get a cross-division, some terms (such as ‘strong’) being applied to varieties of both classes. cf. 64—66.
footnote ¹ And so here we have a term which possibly is applied only to the one class of ‘evil’ odours. 2 Which is not an ‘evil’ odour. 3 i.e. putridity is a quality which things acquire as they decay, and does not necessarily imply that they are them-selves formed out of decaying matter. In fact things so produced are not always ‘putrid. ’ 4 The sense is apparently that ‘lighter’ (or less solid) things exhale a lighter and pleasanter odour because in their
footnote ¹ in Thrace. cf. Arist. H.A. 9. 36. Turn. quotes an illus-tration from Seriptor θαυμασίων ἀκουσμάτων 126. 2 εὐωδίαις. ?εὐώδεσι.
footnote ¹ cf. H.P. 1. 11. 2. 2 i.e. the berry: Sch. would read ἀρκευθίς. cf. H.P. 3. 12. 4, with which this statement is inconsistent. Sch. suggests punctuating—γλυκὺ ὄν. καὶ εἰ μή πανταχοῦ ἀλλ᾿ ἐνιαχοῦ καὶ ἡ ἄρκευθος κ.τ.λ. 3 καὶ φυτοῖς om. Turn. ⁴ αἷς I omit; ᾗ καὶ τὂ εὐ. conj. Turn.
footnote ¹ I have supplied μίξεις to fill the lacuna marked by W. after οὕτως αἱ; the text to the end of the section is defective, but a makeshift restoration and rendering seem possible: the sense of οὕτως is obscure.
footnote 1 cf. 67; Arist. de Sens. 5. cf. Arist. l.c. 3 As opposed to wine. Sch., misunderstanding this, thinks ξηρῶν corrupt. 4 I have restored καὶ, which Sch. and W. omit, missing the point of the annthesis μὲν . . . δέ.
footnote ¹ i.e. of the unadulterated wine and of the perfume. ² C. P. 6. 19. 2. Sch.’s reasons for bracketing this sentence seem inadequate. ³ i.e. fragrant leaves, etc. cf. H.P. 1. 12. 4. ⁴ Made from the rhizomes: cf. H. P. 1. 7. 2, and Index.
footnote ¹ This passage was misunderstood by Plin. 13. 19. The sense seems to be that the viscous character of oil, though preservative of perfume, is not easily receptive of it. ² cf. H.P. 4. 2. 1; 4. 2. 6. βάλανος, balanites aegyptiaea See Index.
footnote ¹ τὸ conj. Sch.; τι Vulg.W. Sh. also adds ἀμυγδάλων after πικρῶν. 2 i.e. those derived from the Egyptian balanos and bitter almonds.
footnote ¹ I have bracketed καὶ. 2—2 This passage is omitted, apparently by accident, in both W.’s texts, though represented in his Latin version. I
footnote ¹ Dry measure: the equivalents given are, of course, only approximate. ² τὸ βέλτιον ἴρινον W. after Sch.; τὸ βέλτιον τὸ ἴρινον vulg. The article must be omitted in one place or the other. κύπρος, called from a tree of that name: not mentioned in H.P. cf. Plin. 12. 119. 4 cf. H.P. 9.7. 2 and 3. 5 cf. H.P. 9.7. 3.
footnote ¹ cf. Diosc. 1. 58. ² 1 have bracketed καὶ as suggested by Sch. 3 This passage, with some variations, is quoted by Athen. 15. 39. 4 cf. Plin. 13. 11. 5 cf. H.P. 6. 6. 11. for the plant, and for the perfume Athen. 15. 38.
footnote ¹ cf. H.P. 9. 7. 3; C.P. 6. 11. 13. 2 cf. H.P. 2. 8. 4. σπάθην appears to be a conj. of W. for vulg. πλάτην: ἐλάτην Turn. cf. LS. 8. r. ³ Said to be called after the inventor, one Megallos: cf. Plin. 13. 13.
footnote 1· cf. Plin. 21. 42. ² cf. Index. σχοῖνος (2). ³ cf. Index, κάλαμος ὁ εὐώδης.
footnote ¹ cf. C.P. 6. 14. 8 and 11.
footnote ¹ e.g. alabaster, which here at least is spoken of as a kind of stone. ² γὰρ ins. Sch.
footnote ¹ ἡ ins. W. ² ἡ ins. W. ² The words ἄντε δριμὺ are omitted in both W.’ s editions, but represented in his Latin version.
footnote ¹ cf. 57, 58. σύνθετος ὀσμή or σύνθεσις seems to mean a kind of pot-pourri, which was from time to time renewed with fresh rose-petals. Sch. understands σύνθεσις to mean ‘clothes in a wardrobe’ (cf. Lat. synthesis), but it must surely have the same meaning here as σύνθετος ὀσμή: Sch. ’s citation from 57 does not seem to prove his point, and μένουσι πολὺν χρόνον αἱ συνθέσεις in 58 is conclusive against him. cf. also 69.
footnote ¹ cf. 52. ² δὲ ins. W. ² i.e. the case is so far analogous to that of rose-perfume; but the comparison does not hold as to what follows.
footnote ¹ Quoted by Athen. 1. 58. 2 cf. 48. 3 This sentence must be defective: as it stands, the effect of only one wine is given, though the effect is said to be
footnote 1 Sc. a part of the body which, not being fleshy, does not spoil the scent by its warmth. So Plin. 13. 19. appears to give the point—experimentum (vnguentorum) inversa manu capitur, ne carnosae partis calor vitiet, though it may be questioned whether inversa menu represents καρποῦ. Pliny's

footnote ¹ The example is missing. Turn. supplies costum et amomum from Plin. 13. 16, which does not however certainly refer to this passage; see 69, where this passage seems to be repeated. ² The reference of ἐκείνου is obscure. ³ μιχθέντα add. Turn.

footnote ¹ i.e. to form a ‘crust.’ ² τὰ ins. Sch. ³ cf. H.P. 1. 6. 7. ⁴ i.e. when the fat of the living bear becomes abnormally developed. Plin. 8. 128. expresses his surprise at T. ’s credulity 
footnote ¹ i.e. taste. ² There seems to be some confusion here, as in the first sentence of the section T. complained that colours are not classified. The following passage is unusually elliptical, and the text is probably defective T.’a complaint seems to be that sense-experiences in general have been inadequately classified (cf. 2); and in 66 foll. he specially mentions smells.
footnote ¹ I have inserted οὐχ, suggested by Sch. ² Like Sch. I fail to see the relevance of this remark. The sense required is ‘while the fruit is still on the tree’:
