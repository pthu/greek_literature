7971	footnote Desunt omnia in a usque ad c. 6 medium 1. 1 τοιοῦτος] τοσοῦτος be ’ Or. 1 ’ || 2 om διελθὼν δία μέσου ἀυτῶν d || 6 επεισαξεις d 1. So the Son has escaped your slotting; but even among those who shrink from extremes in their opposition to the Son, there are some who think there is no scriptural authority for calling the Holy Spirit God. They part company with the extreme men, and then rejoin them, like roads or rivers that divide and then meet again. 2. διελθὼν διὰ μ.] St John viii 59. This ref. should be added to those given by Tischendorf in loco. 3. λιθοβολεῖ] cp. ii. 2. 6. ἄγραφον] i.e. not so called in Scripture. 7. περὶ τ. υἱ. μετριάζοντες] Ath. ad Serap. i 1 makes the same complaint: ἐξελθόντων μὲν τινῶν ἀπὸ τῶν Ἀρειανῶν διὰ τὴν κατὰ τοῦ υἱοῦ τοῦ θεοῦ βλασφημίαν, φρονούντων δὲ κατὰ τοῦ ἃγ ἴου πνεύματος. See Swete in Diet. Chr. Biogr., s.v. ‘Holy Ghost,' p. 121, 122. ib. ἐπὶ τῶν ὁδῶν evp. ἐ.] Roads and rivers sometimes divide, and then the divergent portions inert again lower down. So here, people differ on most points but agree on others, so that you never can be sure where they agree and where they are at issue.
footnote 2. 2 του υἱοῦ] OM του cd || 3 om οἱ e || 5 αὐτοῖς ἐστιν ce || 7 βρωμάτων] ζητηματων b 2. The enquiry about the Holy Ghost is difficult. Controversialists defeated over the Son attack the Holy Ghost the more eagerly. Good Christians, sick of argument, wish the enquiry left alone. But we must try. I shall not discuss the meaning of ‘ holy ’ and of ‘ Spirit, ’ of of the two words together. That has been done by others. 3. οἱ ἄνθρωποι] The clause χρὴ γάρ τι κτλ., as well as the opposed ἀλλ’ ὅτι καὶ ἡμεῖς, shows that Gr. does not mean 'men,' including good Christians who dislike controversy, but ’the men,' i.e. his opponents. Their very failure, and the exhaustion of their arguments about the Son ἀποκαμόντες), make them the more keen in their attack upon the Spirit. 6. ἀποκναισθέντες] Cp. i 2. 7. κακοσίτοις] ’squeamish about their diet.’ ib. ot ἐπειδὰν κτλ.] The MSS. appear to give no sign of any other reading, but the grammar is in hopeless confusion. The simplest remedy would be to strike out οἳ before ἐπειδάν, and to insert it before πρὸς πάντα. Otherwise we must suppose that some words have fallen out after ἀηδισθῶσι, such as πάντα ἀποστρέφονται, followed by ἡμεῖς οὖν to begin a new sentence. The required sense is plain, though it cannot be got out of the present text : that as people of delicate stomach, who have had something offered them which they dislike, turn against food in general, so we, disgusted with the Eunomian arguments about the Son, are disinclined to listen to arguments of any kind about the Spirit, or indeed on any religious subject. 9. ὁ λόγος δραμεῖται] 1 Thess. iii 1. As, however, ὁ λόγος is here ’the ’ and not directly ’the word of ’ Gr. shrinks from making it the subject of δοξασθήσεται, as in St Paul. 11. ποσαχῶς] in how many different senses the words πνεῦμα and ἄγιος are used in Scripture. 13. μαρτυριῶν] ’ the texts that bear upon the investigation.’
footnote 2 ταυτα...ταυτα] ταὐτὰ . . . ταὐτὰ ceg || 4 τρεψώμεθα eg 3. 5 θέον τινα b || 12 0] ω ‘ Reg. a, Or. 1’ 3. ἐπεὶ καὶ ἡμεῖς] The use of ἐπεί, where perh. we might have expected ὡς, seems to be in favour of the reading ταὐτά, which would thus be taken to mean, ’since we agree with ’ But the mss. are not of very great value in matters of this kind (and it must be remembered that the principal MS. fails us at this point) ; and it would be difficult to supply a verb that would suit ταὐτά, which the obvious φιλοσοφοῦμεν would not do. Ἐπεὶ will therefore indicate that the proposed division of labour is a fair one : the ἔτεροι (by whom Gr. prob. means, not Basil, but students who wer still living to profit by his labours), have worked at that particular study for our advantage as well as their own, and we will leave it to them, since we are labouring at this other for theirs as well as ours. 3. Zeal for the letter ὁ Scripture is sometimes a cloak for My confidence in the Godhead of the Holy Ghost is absolute. He ἲς the Light that lighteneth every man, equally with the Father and the Son. I will fearlessly proclaim Him. 5. παρέγγραπτον] wrongly entered on the list ; cp. iii 18. 7. πρόπολεμοῦντες τ. γρ] Gr. will not say τῆς γραφῆς ; cp. iv 1 οἱ τοῦ γράμματος ἱερόσυλοι. ib. ἐκεῖ φοβούμενοι φ.] Ps. Iii 6 (Hii 5). 11. εἰς δύναμιν] ’ to the best ὁ our power.’ 12. θαρροῦμεν τῆ θ.] ‘have such confidence ’ not merely in the sense of believing that the thing is so, but in that of resting upon it for support. ib. πρεσβεύομεν] ’revere’; cp. i 5. 13. τῆς θεολογίας] ‘of θὶς account of the Godhead. ’ For numerous exx. of the use of the word, see Suicer s.v. ib. ἐντεῦθεν] explained by the clause τὰς αὐτὰς . . . ἐφαρμόζοντες.
footnote 7 πρότερον ἐφαντάσθη dg || 11 θεολογίαν] ὁμολογίαν b || 13 καὶ κηρύσσομεν] om καὶ f || 15 ησυχαζοντες] ἡσυχάσομεν f 1. ἢν τὸ φῶς] John i 9. There is no need to suppose that Gr. intends to make ἦν into a mere copula ; ‘ the true light was the Father.' Ὁ πατὴρ would more naturally be in apposition to τὸ φῶς. 8. ἐν τῷ φωτί σου] Ps. xxxv 10 (xxxvi 9). Both parts of the verse are frequently quoted by the Fathers as containing the doctrine of the Trinity. For the first half cp. Ambr. de Sp. S. i 15. 9. τεθεάμεθα κτλ.] The passage is influenced by 1 John i 3, 5. ib. ἐκ φωτὸς τοῦ πατρός] This is implied in the word ’Thy ’; the Holy Ghost is the ’s light, which implies that the Source from which He proceeds is light also. 12. ὁ ἀθετῶν κτλ] Is. xxi 2; with possibly a reminiscence of Ez. iii 27. 13. ἐπ’ ὄρος ὑψηλόν κτλ.] Is. xl. 9 ἐπ’ ὄρος ὑψ. ἀνάβηθι ὑψώσατε, μὴ φοβεῖσθε· εἰπόν . . . Ἴδου ὁ θεὸς ἡμῶν. 14, εἰ μὴ κάτωθεν ἀκ.] Gr. prob. thinks of his favourite reference to Moses on Sinai, and of the unpre-pared people who were forbidden to go up with him. 15. εἰ δὲ καὶ φοβ.] ’and if we should be afraid at all, it will be for holding our peace , not for proclaim-ing Him? 4. There never was α time when He was not. No one person of the Trinity can be imagined to exist or to have ever existedwithoutthe others ; for an imperfect Godhead is unthinkable; able; especially a Godhead holiness. If He ever began to exist, He is on a level with us. How could He raise us, as He does, to Godhead?
footnote 4. 1 om τὸ ἄγιον cef2g || 1 τρια] + ἢν f || 4 θεότης εἰ μὴ τελεια] θεοτητος ἡμιτέλεια b : θεότητος εἰ μὴ τέλεια d : θεότης ἦ εἰ suprascr.) μὴ τέλεια c ||   δ’ av] ’δε c || 7 η γαρ] εἰ γὰρ dfg || η αγιοτης] om η e || 8 η αυτη] αὔτη ceg || 10 δίχα] + TOudfg || 11 ἄπο] + του ’duo Colb.’ 3. μηδὲ τὰ δύο θῆς ἄνω] ‘Ι veilture to tell you not to set the other two up ’ because it is useless and illogical to attempt it. 4. εἰ μὴ τελεία] I retain this reading in the text, as it has most authority and makes good sense ; but I have little doubt that the true reading, which would account for the variants, is ἡ μὴ τελεία. 6. μὴ τοῦτο ἔχουσα] By τοῦτο Gr. means the Holy Ghost. 7. ἢ γὰρ ἄλλη τις] Besides the superior Ms. authority for ἢ, it accords better with the καἰ before ἤ τις, which would be unintelligible with εἰ. It is quite in ’s style to interpose the question with λαὶ before passing on to the second horn of the dilemma. ‘ Either the holiness of the Godhead is independent of the Holy Spirit, — and in that case I should like to be informed what it is supposed to be; or if ’ etc. 10. μετ’ ἐμοῦ] in company with creatures like us. 5. The Sadducees denied His existence. Some of the best Greek thinkers had glimpses of Him, but there was no agreement among them on the point. Christians likewise are divided. While some believe Him to be God, some think Him α Divine operation, or even α creature; some make nice distinctions between His nature and those of the Father and Son. 14. μικρὸν ἄνωθεν] ‘a little farther back’; the same comparative use which we observed iu πόρρωθεν ii 2. 15. διειλήφαμεν] ’ have discussed’; cp. iv 16.
footnote 5, 9 οὐδέτερον] οὐδὲν ἕτερον f ΙΙ 11 πέρι αὐτοῦ] πέρι αὐτὸ c2 || 14 σοφὼ. τερῶν] σοφώτερον ’in nonnull.’ 1. οὐδὲ γὰρ ἀγγ.] Acts xxiii 8. Gr.'s remark is not exactly logical γάρ) ; the denial of angels would not involve the denial of the Holy Spirit. It looks as if he had carelessly taken πνεῦμα in that passage to = ἅγιον πν. 3. διαπτύσαντες] Cp. τοσαύτας Gr. prob. means, as De Billy interprets, tot ac tanta. id. Ἑλλήνων δὲ οἱ θ.] no doubt esp. Plato and Aristotle. If the actual expression νοῦς τοῦ παντός does not occur in Plato, the thought is there, and prob. the expression itself in some of the Neo-Platonists. The phrase τὸν θύραθεν νοῦν comes from Arist. de Gen. An. ii 3. 5. διηνέχθησαν] ’’they differed,' i.e. from one another. 6. τῶν δέ καθ’ ἤμ’. σ.] ‘of our own clever people,' as opp. to Ἑλλήνων. There is an ironical tone in σοφῶν, because, although orthodox divines are included in the phrase, Gr. is thinking most of the heretical doctors. 11. μέσως πως...διακ.] ‘ hold a kind of neutral position with regard Him.’ 12. Βy τὰς 12. ἄχρι διανοίας] Like the μέχρι which has occurred several times in these Orations, ἄχρι means ‘in thought and no father.’ They have not the courage to express it. 14. ἄλλων δὲ ἤ·κουσα] 1 1 have heard others, still cleverer, meting out Godfrequently head? It is not known whom he means. 15. τὰ νοούμενα] ‘that our notion is that of three existences.’ The is used throughout to avoid undue handling of personal language. 16. διέστησαν] 1st aor., ‘ they put them at such a distance from each other, as to make the first’ etc.
footnote 5 νομιζοντας] -τες b 6. 7 ουδεις] ουδεις ο b: ουδε εις ce ‘duo Reg.’ || 9 διαλεξωμεθα b 2. ἄλλον τρόπον μιμ.] ‘imitating, though in a somewhat different form, those,‘ etc. He seems to mean Arius. 4. τάξιν καὶ χάριν] The word χάρις appears to be used in the sense which Lidd. and Scott put as iv 2 viz. ‘homage due,’ ‘majesty’; and τάξις accordingly will be, not exactly the order in which the names stand in the Bible, but the rank which is inherent in each. ‘Who think that the rank and dignity of the respective names denotes a gradation of the realities which they represent.’ The πράγματα, of course, are the three Blessed Persons themselves. 6. Against Sadducee and Greek I shall not indulge myself to argue, but only against the others. The Holy Ghost is either a contingent or a substantive existence. If contingent, He must be a Divine operation or influence; but this does not agree with the personal language of Scripture. If He is a substantive existence, He is either God or a creature; there is no betwixt and between. If He is a creature, how can we ‘believe in’ Him? He must be God. 8. ἁμαρτ. ἐλαίῳ] Ps. cxl (cxli) 5. It may be asked, why it would be an anointing of himself with the oil of sinners for his oration to enter into controversy with such persons, while he feels himself at liberty to argue with the Macedonians. The answer is, that the ἁμαρτωλοὶ are not opponents (as the Donatists might have said) too bad even to be argued with. He means that, although it might add a richness and profusion to his discourse, there would be a kind of sinful self-indulgence in demolishing opinions with which he was not practically confronted. 9. τῶν καθ’ ἑατυτὸ ὑφ.] ‘either an independent subsistence, or a thing observed in something else.’ 12. συμβεβηκός] something contingent, ‘a contingency’; a thing which happens to be so, but might have been otherwise. 13. ἐνέργεια τοῦτο ἂν εἴη θ.] ‘it (the Holy Spirit so conceived of) will be an operation of God’— an influence, an inspiration, or the like—‘for what else could it be, or from whom besides could it come?’
footnote 1 και ει] om ει b || 2 τω] το b || 7 υπολειφθησεται ‘Or. 1’ 1. φεύγει σύνθεσιν] It is assumed that all will agree that the simpler the account, the better. 2. ἐνεργηθήσεται . . . παύσεται] The fut. is logical, not temporal. It is of the very nature of an ‘operation ’ to be incapable of independent action, or to continue when the operator stops. 3. πῶς οὖν ἐνεργεῖ] The Bible, however, attributes to the Holy Spirit operations of His own, such as ‘saying’ this and that (τάδε), ‘separating’ (an inexact reminiscence of Acts xiii 2). 4. λυπεῖται] Eph. iv 30. 5. παροξύνεται] Is. lxiii 10. ib. κινουμένου] middle voice. These are notes, Gr. says, not of a motion in the abstract (such as an ἐνέργεια is), but of the thing which is in motion. 6. τῶν περὶ τὴν οὐ.] ‘an existence, and not an attribute of existence.’ 9. τραγελάφους] the typical fabulous compound. 10. τελειούμεθα] in baptism; cp. § 29. ib. οὐ γὰρ ταὐτόν] ‘it is not the same thing to believe in anything, and to believe statements about it; the first is peculiar to God, the second can be done with any thing.’ See Pearson on the Creed I believe in God; who rightly says that the distinction is more characteristic of Western than of Eastern theology. 13. οὐδὲ ποίημα] sc. ἐστί. The apodosis begins at this point, not at ἀλλ᾿ οὐ κτίσμα. 7. Now it is your turn. ‘Is He begotten, or unbegotten? If begotten, of whom ? If of the Father, there are two Sons; if of the Son, He is a grandson.’ Your names do not terrify me. Because we are obliged to speak of ‘Sonship’ in the Godhead, it does not follow that all earthly nomenclature would apply; or at that rate you will have to say ali manner of strange things.
footnote 7, 4 υποδιαιρησει ’Reg. Copr.' || 15 τῆς] τὰς b ΙΙ 18 omn ’Reg. a’ 1. ἐνταῦθα σὸς 6 λ.] ‘now for your say’ It begins at ἢ ἀγέννητον. 3. δύο τὰ ἄναρχα] viz. the Father and the Spirit. 6. σὺ δέ μοι πλ.] This is Gr.'s interpolation into his adversary's argument. 7. φιλοσώματος] i.e. determined to refer everything to material standards. 9. σοφοὶ τοῦ κακ’.] Jer. iv 22. It is hard to see why Gr. balances this clause by ‘ and will not write what is good.' It is not a reference to anything in Scripture. No doubt the Eunomian literature was as extensive as its oral polemic. 11. τὰ πράγματα] much as at the end of § 5. The ’names’ which he says would not scare him ὅσ’ are such as that of υἱωνός. Not that he admits that such a name would necessarily be applicable, even if the ‘ facts ’ were as suggested. is shewn in the next sentence. 12. κατά τινα σχ. ὑψ.] ‘according to sonic relationship too lofty for us to understand' the Son is Son. No other language would express at once His derivation from the Father and His being of one substance with Him. It does not follow, however, that all the nomenclature of our earthly relationships is to be trans-ferred straightway to the Godhead. 20. εἰ δέ σοι κ· τοῦτο π·] ’and if you like to carry the gamt farther i cp. iii 7 προσπαιξω τὸν π.
footnote 3 om καὶ Οὐαλεντίνου aceg 8, 8 οἱ υἱωνοὶ] om οι df || 9 λυθεισης] διαλυθείσης bdf || 16 om ἐκπορεύεται f 1. συγγενόμενον] ‘ by intercourse with His own ’; cp. iii 6. The ’ancient ’ are prob. those of heathen mythology, not of Gnosticism. 3. Μαρκίωνος] Marcion's system has really nothing to do with Gnosticism and its fantastic inventions, although he is usually reckoned among the Gnostics. Perh. therefore Gr. uses his name with that of Valentinus to denote in contemptuous indifference Gnosticism in general ; or perh. he confuses Marcion with Marcus, the disciple of Val., from whom the Marcosians take their name. ib. θεὸς ἀρρενόθηλυς] Gr. does not mean that Val. taught that God was ἀρρ., but only compares the God who has just been imagined with the bisexual beings of the Valentinian system. See Iren. I i 1 εἶναι γὰρ αὐτῶν ἕκαστον ἀρρενόθηλυν, οὔτως· τως· πρῶτον rbv Προπάτορα ἡνῶσθαι κατὰ συζυγίαν τῆ ἑαυτοῦ Ἐννοίᾳ κτλ. 4. αἰῶνας] ’who devised those strange Acons.’ 8. I do not admit thai He must be either begotten or unbegotten. Christ says that He ’proceeds? You ask what that means. Our powers are insufficient to explain. 9. ἀρχῆς] as in ii 25, an ‘ end? Δεσμός seems to be used in the sense of a hnot. ib. τῆς θ. ὑποχωρήσαντες] ‘retiring ing from your account of the God-head.’ 14. διὰ τὴν τρίτην σ. δ.] ‘ to suit your Third Testament? or, as we might say, ’your Newest Testament.’ ib. τὸ πν.... ἐκπορεύεται] John xv 26. 15. ἐκεῖθεν] from such a source as the Father.
footnote 2 διαφυγὼν d || 3 ισχυροτεροσ] υφηλοτερος ’tres Colb.' || 6 παραπληκτισομεν bedf 9, 13 υιον] υιω b || 14 ἐλλιπὴς cd2f2 || 15 om διάφορον sec. loco e || 17 om τι b || ουδε] οὐ c || 18 λειψει] λείπει c || 19 υἱὸν] υἱὼ b 1. ἀγενν. κ. γενν. μέσον] Theterm ἐκπορεύεσθαι denotes a relationship to the Unbegotten Father which is at least not more distant than that of Generation, and therefore implies the essential Deity of Him who so proceeds. 5. φυσιολογήσω] ‘ will tell you the natural history of.’ 6. παραπληκriσωμεν] ‘ and let us both go mad for prying into the secrets of God' ; a well-known superstition. 7. καἰ ταῦτα τίνες] ‘ and who are we that we should pry into them ?' 8. ψάμμον θαλασσῶν κτλ.] Ecclus. i 2. 10. θεοῦ βάθεσιν] ι Cor. ii 10. ib. λόγον πἐχειν] ‘ to submit’ ’present an account.’ 9. ‘Where does He come short of being a Son ? yon ask. . It is no defect, any more than it is a defect in the Son not to ἠ’ Father, or in the Father not to be Son. The names ’denote unalterable relationships within a single nature. 14. ἐκφάνσεως] The difference of designation corresponds to B real difference in the mode of Their coming forth into existence, and of Their mutual relation. Ἔκφανσις does not mean Their manifestation to us, but Their eternal issuing forth from the First Source. 19. ἀλλ’ οὐκ ἐλλ. τ. ποθεν] ’but this language does not indicate a in any direction, nor the inferiority of essence.' The ταῦτα not refer only to what has immediately preceded, viz. that the Father is not Son ; this would not suggest any thought of ὕφεσις. It refers also to the ’s not being Father, nor the Spirit Son.
footnote 2 τὸ γεγεννησθαι] το γεγενῆσθαι a: om καὶ τὸ γεγεννῆσθαι f || 3 εκπεπορευσθαι αἰ ’Reg. Cypr.' || 6 αξια] εξουσια e || 7 ὑίος] ο ὑίος a || 8 o ὑίος] om ο d || om τὰ f || 9 om τῆ bed || 10 νυν] σου νυν b ’Reg. Cypr.' : om νυν c : νυνι e 4. προσηγόρευσεν] The abovementioned facts ’proclaim Them ’ respectively Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. The aor. takes us back to the moment when these titles were first assigned in Scripture. 5. ποστάσεων] here used in the recognised ’personal’ sense. 7. δπερ ὁ πατήρ] He is not the Father, but He is all that the Father is. ib. δτι ἐκ τοῦ θ.] The fact that He is of the Father's essence (1 Cor. ii 12) does not make Him Son. 8. ἐν τὰ τρία τῆ θ.] The Three (Gr. again avoids the masc.) are One — an undivided unit — in their nature; the One is Three — a Trinity — in the ineffaceable distinction between the persons. The latter observation removes the Sabellian conception of the unity ; the former removes the Eunomian division of the natures. In the construction of the last clause, τῆς π. ν. διαιρέσεως is the predicate after ἦ understood, like οὐκ ἐλλείψεως above. 10 You are surprised at our calling Him God, consubstantial with the Father. He must be so if there is only God God and one Godhead. I am ashamed to use earthly illustrations; but even in natural history there are very different modes of reproduction which it might help you to consider. 12. δὸς οὖν μοι] The word διδόναι is not used here in its frequent sense of a logical concession ; for it would be no concession to the Eunomians to ’give’ what is here required. It means rather, ’shew me’ ‘convince me that it is so.’ The Eunomian offers, if convinced that two consubstantial persons issue from the same Divine Source, to acknow-ledge each of them to be a God. Gr. illustrates the illogical character of the offer by a counter-paralogism. ‘Shew me,’ he says, ‘that there is than one sort of God, and I will shew you the same Trinity that we now believe in, name and thing.’ It is as unreasonable to deduce ditheism or tritheism from the Catholic doctrine of the relation of the Son and Spirit to the Father, as it would be to deduce the Catholic doctrine of the Trinity from a belief in Godheads of varying quality.

Luke xxiv 5. 13. ἡμῖν γνώριμα] known to us all by direct observation; opp. to what only few have had the opportunity of noting. Gr.’s lore on subject is derived from Aristotle. 16. ἐξ ἑτέρων τὰ αὐτά κτλ.] instance given by Elias is that of frogs, some of which are the off-spring of frogs, and others the spontaneous product of the marsh, and yet equally frogs. His instance of the converse is more true to nature, but a less exact illustration of his subject. 19.δαπανώμενον] ‘consumed,’ cp. iv 6. The ref. of course is to the phoenix (Herod, ii 73); see Lightfoot's note on Clem, ad cor. § 25. Gr. himself evidently does not quite believe the fable.
footnote 11. 9 ταὐτὸν] ταύτα acg || ΙΙ τὰ] τὸ e || 1 7 φασιν] φησιν c 1. εἰς ἄλλα μεθιστάμενα] Elias very properly instances gnats, as out of larvae. It was prob. not known that such larvae invariably developed into gnats, or that all gnats had been such larvae. 2. φιλοτιμίᾳ φ] ‘in nature's eagerness to excel’; cp. ἢ φ. ἐφιλοτεχνήσατο above. ib. ἤδη δὲ καὶ τοῦ αὖ] The same creature produces offspring in more than one way, by generation and otherwise; and both kinds of off-spring have the same nature as the parent. Gr. is prob. thinking of the way in which some low forms of animal life appear (like plants) to be propagated by ‘cuttings’ as well as by ‘seed.’ 4. τῷ παρόντι] ‘the case in point,’ i.e. of the Holy Spirit. 11. Human history, however, presents a better, if still an incomplete, illustration. Adam, Eve, and Seth came into being in very different ways; yet they are consubstantial. 9. ταὐτόν σοι φ.] ‘to have the same nature.’ 14. ἐπιφυέσθω] Cp. i 4. 15. θεωρῶν ὡς ἐπὶ σκ] These earthly illustrations form a kind of stage upon which the higher things are represented for our study. 17. οὐ γὰρ τοῦ ἑνός] This is part of the objection, not of Gr.’s reply. From the one person of the Father, they say, there cannot issue two others, one by generation, the other in some other way.

You say that the Spirit is not, in Scripture, an object of worship. It is at least ‘in in the spirit’ that we worship, and that which we worship ‘is Spirit.’ He is so entirely one with the object of worship, that worship addressed to the Father is equally addressed to the Holy Ghost. Again, you object that ‘all things were made through the Son,’ and therefore the Holy Ghost among them. No more, I answer, than the Father was. He was made at all.

This is based upon the text first quoted, in which the object of the worship πνεῦμά ἐστιν. Not that Gr. definitely takes the first πνεῦμα in that text to be the Holy Ghost ; but on the principle that worship offered to one person of the Trinity is offered to all, his reasoning is correct, if his premisses are accepted. It must be owned, however, that he somewhat begs the question. 7. πάντα διὰ τοῦ υἱ.] John i 3. 11. τῳ υἱῷ δός] ‘assign assign Him to the Son’ as one of the things which were made through Him. 12. τῷ περιληπτικῷ] ‘your comprehensive phrase will not help you.’ 16. κακῶς τιμῶν κατὰ] ‘wrongly honouring the Father at the expense of the Only-begotten.’ 18. οὐ γὰρ ὁμ. δῆμ’.] sc. τοῦ πνεύματος ὁ υἱός. 19. μετὰ σεαυτοῦ] Cp. § 4 μετ’ ἐμοῦ.

It is painful to revive a long-dead controversy; but I must defend myself against the charge of Tritheism. It is brought against us both by those who go all lengths in unbelief, and by some who are fairly orthodox with regard to the Son. To the latter I would say that they are equally open to the charge of Ditheism. 4. ἐπ’ αὐτὸ κεφ.] ‘to the fundamental question itself,’ viz. how reconcile the Godhead of the Three Persons with the unity of God. 5. τῆ πίστει παραχ.] ‘that had yielded to faith.’ 7. λογολέσχας] like ἀδολέσχας, ‘praters.’ ib. μὴ ἐρ. ἁλῶναι] a law term, freq. in Demosth., ‘to have judgment given against us by default.’ agrees with δίκην understood, which is a kind of cognate ace. alter ἁλῶναι. ib. λόγον ἔχ.] used m a kind of double sense, which after all is but one; ‘to have the Word,’ and have reason.’ 9. πολυαρχία τὸ δ.] ‘how can the object which you glorify not be polytheistic?’ Cp. iii 2. 10. ταῦτα τίνες·] ‘who is it that says this?

Gr. asks, because part of his argument will apply to both sections, and part — that which comes next — only to the latter. 14. τί φατε] ‘What do you say to us Tritheists?’ i.e. What argument can you urge against us, whom you call Tritheists, which will not equally apply to yourselves, who worship the Son, even if you have departed from the Spirit?

To both parties I answer thus. There is but one God, and one Godhead; and though there are three Persons, there is but one Source from which all that belongs to the Godhead issues. Between these three Persons there is no kind οἱ division or inequality, as there is between the specimens of a limited class. 13. εἷς θεός, ὅτι μ. θ.] ‘There is but one God, because there is only one thing that can be called Godhead.’ If there could be different kinds of Godhead, we might imagine many Gods; but as the thing is necessarily unique, we cannot conceive of it as the possession of several personages independent each other. This argument, of course, is based on philosophical grounds, not on divine revelation ; but it bears witness to the reasonadvocacy ableness of that revelation. ib. πρὸς ἐν τὰ ἐξ αὐτοῦ] Cp. iii 2 πρὸς τὸ ἐν τῶν ἐξ αὐτοῦ σύννευσις. The personalities issuing from a single source are referred back to that source so as to be but one with it, although we recognise that they are three. The αὐτοῦ is neuter. It refers to ἔν. 15. τὸ μὲν μᾶλλον] The Benedictine editors compare Leo Serm. viii in Nat. Chr. ‘gradus in uera diuinitate esse non possunt. quidquid deo minus est, deus non est.

Damasc. de Fide Orth. viii. 3. ἐν ἡλίοις τρίσιν] The illustration tration only shews the impossibility of illustration. ‘There suns joined to each other’ might appear to us one, but their relation to each other would be very different from that of the Three Divine Persons. 6. τὸ φανταζόμενον] The word does not imply that our observation is untrue, but only that it is (necessarily) inadequate. Cp. e.g. ii 6 18, 19. ib. πρὸς τὰ ἐν οἷς ἢ θ.] ‘ at the Persons in which the Divine nature resides, and which issue from the First Cause, deriving from it Their existence above all time and with an equality of glory, there are Three objects for our adoration.’ avoids saying τρεῖς οἱ προσκ., not only, as so freq., for the sake of reverence, but because it sounds at first as if the three were ‘separate individualities’ like ourselves. also has its dangers, as possibly suggesting differences of nature ; but in the context this danger is removed. It is possible that Gr. here means to speak of the Father Himself as ἐκ τῆς πρώτης αἰτίας; but. if so, that πρώτη αἰτία is within Himself. He is the source of His own being. 15. The Greeks, it is true, spoke of α single Divine nature, compatible with plurality ; ἃς is the case also with human nature. But in these cases, each individual has but a fragment of the whole nature, varies, not only from all other partakers of it, but from himself also, by change. This holds true even of angels. 13. μόνον ἐπινοίᾳ θ.] In the case of the heathen polytheism, the common Godhead exists only as a conception or generalisation of the philosopher; it has no existence in fact. Each individual deity differs greatly from the other in history, and character, and capacities. The same holds true of the specimen man in relation to the human genus.

It is said that things of the same nature are numbered together, so that if the three Persons are consubstantial they must be three Gods. For fear of saying this, you deny the Godhead of two of them, which is like cutting your throat for fear of dying. 18. τὰ ὀμ. συναριθμεῖται] Things of the same nature, like men, trees, or horses, come under a number which sums them up, as three trees, four horses, five men ; you cannot, acc. to the disputant, apply them to heterogeneous things, and class a tree, a horse, and a man together as being three.

On the principle just laid down, he says, if the Father, the Son, and the Spirit can be called three at all, it can only be as three Gods ; that is, your doctrine is incurably tritheistic Ours is not, he adds ; for we deny the identity of essence, and make no at bringing those beings together under a number. 4. πραγμάτων] ‘of trouble’; not τῶν πρ., ‘the facts.’ 7. τῆ μ. συνιστάμενος] ‘to save yourself labour in maintaining monotheism you have denied the Godhead, and abandoned to the enemy the very thing which you are seeking to establish.’ 18. I do not know zvhere you get your rule from. To To me, a number only says how many things there are, and tells anothing about their nature. Certainly in the Bible, things of different natures are summed up under a common number. 12. μοναδικὴν ἔχει τ. δ.] ‘can only be designated singly’; e.g. a and a man, and a tree. 13. δόγμ’. καὶ μυθ.] a kind of hendiadys, ‘makers of fabidous deattempt crees.’ 14. τῆς πόσ’. τῶν ὑποκ.] ‘denotes the quantity, or sum, of the and not their nature.’ 15. οὕτως ἀρχ’. ἔχω] ‘am am old-fashioned enough ’ to say ‘three’ when there are three things, even when they are not of the same kind, and to name them singly, if I choose, even when they thinking only of their number and not of their nature. 18. ἄλλως] carries on the irony of ἀρχαίως, ἀμαθῶς.

Gr. does not observe that God and Mammon are not actually described as two masters, and that if they were, it would be ἃς masters that they would be numbered together, in which respect they are alike. 19. If you tell me that numbers denote things of one nature and those only, then I will deny that you can say ‘three men,’ unless each three is an exact repetition of the others. St John was certainly not bound by your rule when he spoke of the three witnesses nor will it when you come to speak of things of different natures but bearing the same name. 16. οἷς συνεκφ. καταλλ. κ. τ. ὀ.] The opponent explains that things ranged under a number, because they are of the same nature. he means cases where the noun is expressed and the numeral agrees with it (oἷς i.e. συναριθμουμένοις practically = ‘ the numeral’), like ‘three men,’ ‘three God.’ He does not mean that you can never lump together under a neuter numeral heterogeneous objects as so many ‘things.’ This, he says, is not a connumeration.

It will not bear the simplest test of addition or division. Your rules about the order of enumeration, and about the use of prepositions, are just as ridiculous. We will now proceed to give you the coup de grace. 13. οὐκ εἰς δύο συντ.] ‘one and one make two,’ although ace. to the heretic’s logic ‘one and one’ would only be said of things of different nature, such as could never be united under a common numeral. Conversely ‘two is divided into one and οne,’ although ‘two’ can only be said of things of the same nature, which it would be unnatural to describe in that single fashion. The upshot is that the same things proved to be of the same nature and of different natures. Of course the argument is more or less of a piece of banter. 17. προαριθμ. κ. ὑπαριθμ.] Elias says, probably without historical grounds, that this system of numbering (δεύτερος θεός, τρίτος θεός) was derived from the way in which the Neoplatonic writers arranged existences according to a scale, from the First Cause to the lowest. The phraseology is fully discussed by Basil l. c. (de Sp. S. 17.)῾Υπαριθμεῖν’, as distinguished from συναριθμ., is to reckon in a secondary position.

The words ἢ ἀθετήσομεν, ἐπειδὴ οὐ γέγραπται seem to be an ancient gloss to explain ἢ διαγράψομεν. They offer no real alternative to it ; and the variation of the mss. which contain them between ἢ and καὶ ἢ indicates the uncertainty of their footing. If they are to be retained, the only sense that can be got out of them would be this: — Shew us the words ἀγέννητον, ἄναρχον in the Bible, and we will either reject the Holy Ghost’s Divinity for not being found there, or (if we can prove that it is there) we will erase both it and your two words together. But this would be very cumbrous. Omitting the words, the sense is plain. Gr. retaliates ; — Shew us ἀγένν., ἄναρχ. in the Bible, or we will discard them, and you will die by your own rules. The perf. τέθνηκας gives vividness to the argument. Probably the gloss was introduced because Gr. ’s word διαγράψομεν seemed itself to imply that the words ἀγέννητον etc. were to be found written in Scripture. How can that be erased which was never written? The scribe wished to substitute for διαγρ. the more general word ἀθετήσομεν, ‘because the expressions in question are not written.’ It may be that the correction might be due to Gr. himself; but (1) its place in the MSS. is against it; it ought to have followed διαγρ.; (2) by διαγρ. Gr. intended no reference to being found in Scripture ; he meant, if conscious of the metaphor at all, an erasure from the theological writings in which the expressions occurred. 8. τῶν ὀνομάτων] sc. ἀγέννητον, ἄναρχον.

See 1 Cor. i 17 foll. 24. This being so, we must not make too much of the reticence Scripture. When you hear of twice five, you are justified in saying ten ; so whatever is clearly implied in Scripture may rightly be affirmed, even if it is not explicitly stated there. I will give you the reason for the reticence of Scripture.

Two great changes have occurred in the history of religion, when inert passed under the first and second Covenants respectively. In neither case was the change violently made. Like a skilled teacher or physician, God made the new order agreeable by permitting for a while something from the old, until mem were ready to give it up of themselves. 3. μεταθέσεις βίων] He calls two dispensations by this title, because he is about to dwell on the practical difficulties attending such transitions. 4. σεισμοὶ γῆς] The ref. is to Heb. xii 26. 5. διὰ τὸ...περιβόητον] ‘because of the celebrity of the thing,’ cause the change was so great and on such a scale as to compel wide attention. 7. ἐντεῦθεν ... ἐκεῖσε] from the present order to that which is beyond. 9. μήδε’ σαλευόμενα] Heb. xii 28. 10. ἀθρόως] Cp. § 22. 12. τὸ μὲν γὰρ ἅκ. οὐδὲ μόνιμον] ‘for what is not voluntary is not lasting either.’ 15. τὸ μὲν τοῦ βίας.] In the one instance, the change would be the work of him who forced it on ; in the other, it is our own. The one kind of change is in keeping with the the considerateness of God ; the other would be a mark of tyrannical power.
footnote 7 μακρω] τῶν μακρῶ b : τὼ μακρῶ def 2. τὸ μὲν ὑφαῖρει] ‘like α school-master or physician, He withdraws some parts of the hereditary system, and leaves others as α concession, giving in upon some small points which tend to keep men happy.’ 5. φαρματτ. τοῖς χρηστ.] ‘being seasoned with something nicer’ than itself. The rhythm of the sentence is in favour of joining διὰ τῆς τέχνης to παραδεχθῇ rather than to φαρμ. 6. ῥᾴστη] used as an equivalent to the simple ῥᾳδία. 7. μακρῷ χρόνω Cp. ii 14. 8. τὰς θυσίας σνεχ.] This, which is the usual patristic view of the legal sacrifices, is well expressed by Cyr. Al. c. Iul. iv p. 126 (Aubert) ; and by Greg, the Great in his letter to Mellitus (Bede Hist. Eccl. i 30). 10. ἐδέξαντο τὴν ὑφ.] ‘as soon as they were reconciled to the with-drawal, they conceded the concession that had been made to them.’ It is not clear at what point Gr. means that the Jews ‘conceded’ the sacrifaces. It ought, ace. to the parallelism, to mean when ‘they became Jews instead of heathens,’ as gave up circumcision when they ‘became Christians instead of Jews.’ This, however, would only be of special representatives of the race, like Samuel and other prophets and psalmists, who taught that obedi-ence was better than sacrifice. If Gr. is not thinking of these, we must suppose that the time when they gave up the sacrifices was practically the same as when they gave up circumcision, i.e. not when they first became ‘Jews,’ but when they became Christians. 13. κλαπέντες] For the use of κλέπτειν cp. i 2. 14. ἐκ τοῦ περιτ. καἰ ἅγν’.] Acts xvi 3, xxi 26. 16. ἐγὼ δέ, ἀδελφοί] Gal. v. 11. Probably Gr. does not mean that this was an advance in St Paul’s views. He can hardly have failed to know that the Ep. to the Gal. was written before the incident in Acts xxi 26. He only means we see St Paul sometimes acting on the principle of οἰκονομία, i.e. departure from what is absolutely best, out of consideration for the circumstances of others, and sometimes on the principle of τελειότης.
footnote 26. 13 προσβαλόντες] προσβάλλοντες be : προβαλόντες ‘Or. 1’ 26. So it was with the doctrine of God, except that the successive changes have been in the direction of believing more truths, not fewer. When the doctrine of the Father was well established, that of the Son was revealed, and when that was accepted, then the doctrine of the Spirit. The Spirit Himself came by degrees. Christ Himself revealed Him only by slow advances. 1. τῆς τῆς θεολογίας] ‘the doctrine of God.’ ib. πλὴν ὅσον ἐκ τῶν ἐν.] ‘except that it follows the opposite order.’ The change of practical system consists in dropping things; the doctrinal change consists in learning additional truths. 6. ἐμπολιτεύεται] ‘is resident and active among us.’ Gr. that the Church learns by experience how to interpret the slight indications of the Holy Ghost’s Divinity given by the N.T. It does not follow that he thought doctrinal advance possible in other directions also. 11. ἐπιφορτίζεσθαι] ‘to be piled on the top of it,’ as an additional to be carried. ib. καθάπερ τροφῆ κτλ.] Cp. i 3. 15. ἀναβάσεσι] Ps. lxxxiii 6 (lxxxiv 5). It is prob. that the words ἐκ δυνάμεως εἰς δύναμιν in ν. 8 (7) suggested the ἐκ δόξης εἰς δόξαν which follows (2 Cor. iii 18). ib. προόδοις] Cp. ii 20.

The progress in our Lord’s statements about the Holy Ghost is traced in four sayings. ib. ἐρωτήσω] John xiv 16. 9. ἀντίθεος] Cp. iv 5. Jesus might have seemed to be setting Himself up as a kind of rival God, and to speak as if by some independent authority, if He had not in the first instance referred the mission of the Holy Ghost entirely to the Father. 10. εἶτα, Πέμψει μέν] John xiv 26. Here, though the ‘mission’ is still referred to the Father, the Son’s request is dropped, and the Spirit is said to be sent ‘in His name.’ 12. εἶτα, Πέμψω] John xv 26. Here the Son’s personal dignity is revealed, as Himself the sender of the Spirit. Gr. of course is not directly rectly speaking of the Eternal Procession. ib. εἶτα, Ἥξει] John xvi 7 (ἔλθῃ). Here the Spirit’s own freedom brought out. It is a correct and useful observation.

Perhaps one of the things which the disciples could not bear while Christ was with them, but were to learn afterwards from the Spirit, was this very doctrine of the Spirit’s Godhead. 1. καὶ ἡμᾶς] as well as our Saviour. τάξιν is ace. after δρᾷς, and ἐκφαίνοντας, κρύπτοντας, agree with ἡμᾶς, not with φωτισμούς, ‘you see light shining upon us by degrees, and an order in the revelation of God.’ 2. ἀθρόως] Cp. § 22. 3. ἄτεχνον] ‘unworkmanlike.’ 4. πλῆξαι] to astonish, and so keep them away from us ; ἀλλότρι’· ὦσαι, because they naturally expect to hear the doctrine taught at the proper time. ib. ὃ δὲ ἴσως μὲν κτλ.] ‘I will add, what may perhaps have occurred to others also before now, but what I take to be the result of my independent thought.’ 8. μὴ δύνασθαι βαστ. ] John xvi 12. 9. δι’ ἃς εἶπον ἴ’. αἴτ’.] in § 26. 10. πάντα διδαχθ.] John xiv 26. 12. τρανουμένην] Cp. ii 4.

Let this be our position then, to worship in one Godhead three undivided Persons. Woe to him zoho does not hold it, or who shifts with the public opinion of the times. If the Holy Ghost gives us the divine nature, He must needs be an object of worship, and in the full sense divine. 3. ἔχω μὲν οὕτω] ‘That is how I stand’: explained, with no construction, by σέβειν. 4. θεὸν τὸν πατέρα] ‘the Father as God.’ Our familiar ‘God Father, God the Son,’ is a of expression peculiar to English Christianity. 6. τῶν μικρῷ πρ. θεοφόρων] ACC. to Elias, the ref. is to Greg.

The timeserver ‘has but weak resolution in regard to the things of most importance.’ 12. θεοῖ] ‘make make α God of me’; iii 19. ib. εἰ δὲ προσκ., πῶς οὐ σεπτόν] Evidently Gr. feels σφιν to be a higher word than the mere external προσκ.; it is already implied in οὐδὲ προσκ. in the line above; but the distinction is not always observed. 14. ἢ χρυσῆ τις] in rough apposition to ἐν. It is difficult to decide between this reading and χρυσῖτις, which has the authority of the best MS. The pronuntialion being identical, it seems natural to choose the rarer word ; but on the other hand the scribe of ‘a’ may have been thrown out by the somewhat unusual combination of ἢ with τις. Cp. ii 19 ἢ αὔρα τις ὀλίγη.

What title, peculiar to God, is there which is not applied to Him, except those of Unbegotten and Begotten?’ The phrase ὧν θεός means, ‘which go to make up our conception of God.’ seems strange to add καὶ γεννήσεως as one of those things ὧν θεός, as those with whom Gr. is arguing would not admit it. Gr. means, no doubt, that to orthodox Christians the Godhead cannot be conceived of without it. 12. ἰδιότητας] as in § 28.

Πληρωτικὸν κόσμου κ. τ. οὖσ’. is scarcely more than a repetition, but is introduced as an antithesis to ἀχώρητον κτλ., which is Gr.’s of the συνέχον τὰ πάντα of Wisdom. 9. ἀγαθόν] Doubtless Gr.’s in Ps. cxlii (cxliii) 10 ; εὐθές, Ps. 1 12 (li 10); ἡγεμ., ibid. 14 (12). ib. φύσει οὐ θέσει] These words qualify the preceding adjectives, and esp. ἡγεμ. The Holy Spirit is ‘good, right, sovereigh,’ by and not by an act that involved a change in Him. Θέσις seems to be used in the sense of ‘agreement,’ ‘arrangement,’ in which sense it is contrasted with φύσις by other writers. From this general sense of ‘agreement,’ it comes to be used of ‘adoption’ into a family, or ‘admission’ to the citizenship of a city. 10. ἁγιάζον] e.g. Rom. xv 16 μετροῦν, ι Cor. xii 1 1 (for οὐ μετρούμενον cp. iv 12); μετεχόμενον, e.g. Phil, ii 1 ; πληροῦν, συνέχον, Wisd. i 7. 12. κληρονομούμενον] not a scriptural phrase, but perh. derived from more general expressions, like 1 Pet. iii 9 εὐλογίαν κλ., or Gal. iii 14 compared with 18; or from the usual language of Scripture about ‘habing,’ ‘receiving,’ the Spirit. Δοξαζόμενον, perh. ι Pet. iv 14; συναριθμ., e.g. Matt, xxviii 19, 2 Cor. xiii 14 ; ἐπαπειλούμενον, ‘used as a threat,’ Matt. xii 31 (cp. 2 Thess. ii 8). 13. δάκτυλος θ.] Luke xi 20 compared with Matt, xii 28 ; πῦρ, Acts ii 3 (cp. 1 Thess. v 19, 2 Tim. i 6); ὡς θεός, Hob. xii 29.

John vi 63 Rom. viii 10). 6. ναοποιοῦν] I Cor. iii 16, vi 19 θεοποιοῦν, constructively deduced from the Sourut’s action in baptism ; τελειοῦν, in the ‘mystical’ sense of ‘initiating.’ All three words have ref. to ‘baptism,’ in the larger sense of the word ; and the ὥστε prob. belongs to all three. It is more difficult to say what Gr. means by this use of ὥστε. Prob. it is intended to shew that the Spirit’s part in baptism is an active, and not a passive part, so as to justify Gr.’s attribution to Him of work of ‘making’ us temples etc. His independence with respect to the sacrament is a proof of this. He is able to ‘anticipate baptism’ (Acts x 44) ; and ‘baptism’ may be received and His indwelling be yet to seek (Acts viii 16). 8. ἐνεργοῦν] 1 Cor. xii 11; μερὶ. ζόμενον, Acts ii 3 ; διαιροῦν, I Cor. xii n; ποιοῦν ἀπ’. κτλ., Eph. iv 11 compared with 1 Cor. xii 4 foll., Rom. xii 6, Acts xx 28. 10. νοερὸν κτλ.] The following list is taken from Wisd. vii 22 foll., which describes the ‘spirit’ which ‘is in Wisdom.’ Gr. does not all the epithets there used, some of which, esp. μονογενές, would have been troublesome for him to expound. Each epithet from νοερὸν to ἀμόλυντον is explained. Νοερόν = σοφώτατον ; πολυμερές = ταῖς ἐνεργ. ; σαφές = σαφηνιστικὸν πάντων (neut.) ; τρανόν = τρανωτικόν ; ἀκώλυτον = αὐτεξούσιον (this shews the order of df to be wrong) ; ἀμόλυντον = ἀναλλοίωτον (since change in the Holy Ghost must be a change for the worse).

The ‘understanding, pure, and most subtle spirits’ in Wisd. ‘through’ which the Spirit ‘goes,’ are, in Gr.’s opinion (no doubt correct), not only ‘the angelic Powers,’ but also the spirits of prophets and apostles. These the Holy Spirit penetrates κατὰ ταὐτό, ‘simultabeously,’ although they are distributed in many different places, which is a proof that He is infinite. 30. Such sayings involve His Godhead. All language of α different kind is explained by the principle of referring all to the Father as the First Cause. 8. οἱ ταῦτα λέγοντες] viz. the sacred writers who used such Ianguage about the Holy Spirit. ib. πρός γε] adv. ‘besides.’ 9. οἶον ἄλλον θ.] The words have a dangerous sound; ‘as it were another God.’ But Gr. does not mean to call Him so. He means that to call Him a Paraclete at all, in the same sense as is equivalent to calling Him God. 10. μόνην εἰδότες ἀσυγχ] Matt. xii 31 foll. 11. στηλιτεύσαντες] The Greek method of proclaiming something to the honour or infamy of a person was to ‘post’ it on a στήλη or post in some publc place. Hence a person subjected to such infamy is described in class. Greek as στηλίτῆς; from whence comes the στηλιτεύειν. 12. ἐψεύσ…ὡς θεόν] Acts v 3 foll. 14. ὡς λίαν] ‘since you really are a very stupid person. 15. πόρρω τοῦ πν] like ἀλλότριοι τοῦ πν. in § 29, ‘unspiritual.’

Illustrations of the doctrine of the Trinity are wholly inadequate ; like mouth, spring, and stream. 10. ὡς ἔγ. π.] ‘How many things!’ 11. πανταχόθεν] Cp. πολυπρ. ii 9. ib. πανταχόθεν] where the English mode of thought would have expected πανταχόσε. 13. ᾦ τινὶ χρὴ τῶν κ.] ‘to what earthly thing I might compare.’ 14. τὸ πλεῖον] ‘the the most improtant part escapes me, leaving me below with my illustration.’ 15. ὀφθαλμόν] The context makes it unquestionable that Elias is right in interpreting the word to mean what is called ὀπή in James iii 11, — the ‘mouth’ out of which the spring issues. No other example of this usage seems to be known; but Gr.’s own language in his poem about the Holy Ghost (iii 60) leaves no room for doubt. He there rejects the same comparison of πόρος, πηγή, ποταμὸς μέγας, ἐν τε ῥέεθρον. It is just possible that Gr. was aware that an ‘eye’ is the ordinary word in Hebrew for a spring; but in any case the metaphor is so natural that it is prob. an accident that we do not find it oftener.

Cp. Tert. adv. Prax. 8. 2. μὴ τῷ μέν] ‘to to see whether.’ 3. ταῦτα γὰρ κτλ.] The mouth, the spring, and the stream are not divided by time, nor is their continuity with each other severed; and yet the three have eacli their special characteristics. 5. ῥύσιν] ‘an incessant waste, or dissipation, of Godhead.’ as in § 30. 8. ἐν ἐστιν ἀριθμῶ They are not really three distinct things, Gr. thinks ; they are only various forms or phases of the same thing, and therefore they are inadequate to express the Trinity, which is essentially three in number. 32. So with sun, ray, and light ; or with the flickering sunshine reflected from water upon a wall. 10. ἤλιον κτλ] Cp. Tert. adv. Prax. 8. 11. κἀνταῦθα δέος] This illustration likewise had its dangers. It might have suggested that the Trinity is a Trinity by some kind of composition or combination, such as the science of Gr.’s time between the su itself and the ray and the light which were ‘in’ the sun. Cp. Or. xliv 4. And secondly there was the opposite danger of suggesting that the Father alone has true positive being, while the Son and Spirit are but faculties of His, without personal subsistence, such being in Gr.’s view the character the ray and the light.

The word is freq. in this sense in Aristtle. 3. ἄλλος ἥλιος] This, ace. to Gr., would be necessary to make the illustration complete. Cp. § 14, and § 30 ἄλλον θεόν. The ray is not the equal of the luminous body which gives it off; whereas in the Trinity there is, as it were, a sun giving off a sun. 4. ἡλιακαί τ. ἀπόρρ.] ‘solar effluences’; Gr. will not even ἡλίου ἀπόρρ., because it might suggest that, once flowing forth, the effluence has some kind of independent existence, whereas his point is that the ray and the light are but properties of the sun. This is further brought out by the addition καὶ ποιότ. οὖσ’. ‘and essential qualities.’ By οὐσιώδεις Gr. seems from the context to mean ’belonging to the nature of the sun.’ Elsewhere, the word is used in a way that would give an almost opposite meaning ; e.g. Or. xli 11 οὐκέτι ἐνεργείᾳ παρὸν ὡς πρότερον, οὐσιωδῶς δέ, ὡς ἂν εἴποι τις, συγγινόμενον ; Cyr. Hier. Cat. Myst. iii 1 πνεύματος ἁγίου οὐσιώδης ἐπιφοίτησις. Ace. to these examples, ποιότητες οὐσιώδεις would rather mean ‘real, substantive qualities.’ In order to suit context, we should then have to understand οὐσιώδεις to have something of a concessive force, ‘qualities after all, however real and substantive.’ 5. καὶ ἄμα τὸ εἶναι κτλ.] The gloss μόνῳ τῷ πατρί gives the right direction for understanding the passage: it means that if we are content with the illustration, we attribute τὸ εἶναι only to the Father, and withhold it from the Son and Spirit. Ἐν τούτοις = in the Persons so conceived of. Thus to ‘God’ (in the sense of ὅλος θεός iv 6) we should ‘attribute at the same time existence and non-existence.’ 7. ἤκουσα δέ τινος] ‘I once heard a man offering the following It is unknown who the man was. 8. μαρμαρυγήν τινα] The illustration, tration, though attractive to the poetical imagination of Gr., is not immediately clear. It seems at first as if the trinity were the sunbeam, the water, and the wall, which combine to produce the παλμός, the dancing and quivering reflexion. The point, however, appears to lie rather in the junction of unity with multiplicity (the number three being for the moment lost sight of) displayed in the vibrations of the sunbeam.
footnote 1 σχεθεισα] χεθεισα ῾El.’ 33. 6 τουτο] τουτω ag ‘tres Colb.’ || 11 ἐννοητέον] cetera desunt in a 1. ὑπολαβοῦσα] ῾assuming,’ ῾catching.’ ib. διὰ τοῦ ἐν μ. ἀέρος] ῾by means of the intervening air.’ Ace. Gr.’s theory, it is the air the water and the wall which communicates to the sunbeam the motion of the water. Cp. ii 12, 13, 22. ib. σχεθεῖσσ τῷ ἀντ’.] ῾arrested by the resisting substance.’ Cp. ii 26 ἀντιτυπούμεναι. 2. παλμὸς ἐγ. καἰ παράδ.] ῾becomes (gnom. aor.) α quivering that quite surprises you.’ ib. ἄττει] = ἀίσσει, ῾vibrates.’ 33. It is α misleading comparison. We do best to content ourselves with the few words given us by revelation for our guidance, and so to press on through life, endeavouring to bring all to join in worshipping Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, in one Godhead. 6. θέσθαι] ῾to lay down as my own.’ 7. τὴν μὲν τὸ κ.] ῾it is very clear what moves the sumbeam.’ contrasted phrase would strictly have run θεὸν δὲ οὐδὲν κινεῖ οὐδόν ἐστι τὸ κινοῦν). 10. τῶν αὐτῶν ὑπ’.] ῾there is a suspicion (or perh. a notion) of the same things.’ things’ as in the case former illustrations. ib. χύσεως] might seem to be in favour of Elias’ reading above. But the point of the illustration there does not lie in that word, whether χεθ. be read, or σχέθ’. Χύσις represents the ῾shedding,’ whether of light or of water, which implies dissipation. 11. ἀστάτου] repeats the στάσιν οὐκ ἔχουσαν of § 31. Cp. Poem. iii 64 οὔτε τις ἐξ ὑδάτων κινήμασιν ἡλιακοῖσι μαρμαρυγή, τοίχοισι περίτρομος, ἀστατέουσα, πρὶν πελάσαι φεύγουσα, πάρος φυγέειν πελάουσα. οὐδὲ γὰρ ἄστατός ἐστι θεοῦ φύσις, ἠὲ μούσα ἠὲ πάλιν συνιοῦσα· τὸ δ’ ἐμπεδόν ἐστι θεοῖο. 12. τὴν διάνοιαν ἵστησιν] ῾nothing to satisfy my mind (lit. which brings it to a stop) when I contemplate illustrations the image which I form.’
