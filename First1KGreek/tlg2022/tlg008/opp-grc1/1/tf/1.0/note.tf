Having spoken of the conditions under which theological subjects jects should be treated, we proceed to our theological enquiry itself, invoking the assistance of the Trinity. 1. ἀνεκαθήραμεν] lit. ’cleaned up’; a ref. to the passage of Plato quoted above p. 11. 3. φωτὶ καταλαμβάνηται φῶς] cf. John i 5; but Gr.'s interpretation of his text is a very doubtful one. 4. ἐπιμελεστέροις] ‘among thougthful men,’ Ἄγονος=ἄκαρπος Mark iv 19. 6. περιφορᾶς] cf. Oral, in Ful. 1 § 100 πλοῦτον, εὐκλείαν, εὐκλείαν, δυναστείαν, ἃ τῆς κάτω περιφορᾶς of Gr. 's. ἐστὶ καὶ ὀνειρώδους τέρψεως. Hesych. renders the word by ἢ κατὰ κίνησις—‘whirl.’ Cp. Plat. Rep. 10 p. 616; Eccl. ii 2. 7. τῷ πνεῦμ’. διακόπτεσθαι] ‘be stopped for want of breath.’ ib. ἐχωρήσαμεν, ἢ χωρούμεθα] Our limits are fixed by our own capacity and by that of those whom we address. 8. ἐνεώσαμεν...ἀκάνθαις] Jer. iv 3. 10. τὸ πρόσ’. τ. γ. ὡμαλίσαμεν] Is. xxviii 25. 12 προστησάμενοι τ. λ.] ’making God the προστάτης, or patron, of the ’;—a favourite expression of Gr's.
footnote 3 τῆς μιας] μιᾶς τῆς d 2. 8 ασθενειαν] ἀλήθειαν cd ’Or. I1’ || 15 προσίτω οὐ γὰρ] προσιτετω οὐδὲ γὰρ ’Or.

Like Moses, Gr. is called up the mountain to converse with He invites his hearers to join him as far as may be permitted, like Aaron or the elders. ’Beasts’ are warned away. 6. ἀνιόντι] Ex. xix 3 foil. 7. ἀγωνιῶντι] ‘filled with anxious fear.’ 8. ἵνα] depends upon ἀνιόντι. τῆς νεφέλης Ex. xxiv 18. 10. Ἀαρών] Ex. xix 24. 11 τοῦτο] sc. ἔξω μένειν. Gr. infrequently uses δέχεσθαι m tne sense of ’accepting’’ a situation, i.e. not rebelling against it. 12. Ναδάβ κτλ.] Ex. xxiv 1. 13. κ. τ. ἀξίαν τ. καθάρσεως] ‘acinto cording to the degree of his purification.’ Cp. Ex. xix 22. 16. πρόσκαιρα γ. ἡγν.] Ex. xix 14, 15. 18. τ. φιλῶν τ. εὐσ. ῥημάτων] Cp. Deut. iv 12 (Heb. xii 19). They are to hear τὰ ψιλὰ ῥ’. as distinguished from attempting to understand depths of their meaning. 20. θη̣ρίον] Ex. xix 13. Cp. Greg. Moral, vi 27 ’bestia montem tangit, cum mens irrationabilibus desideriis subdita ad contemplationis alta se erigit: sed lapidibus percutitur, quia summa non sustinens ipsis superni ponderis ictibus necatur.’
footnote 1 om ἀνήμερον καὶ e ǁ 3 ῥήματος η δόγματος f || 7 κακὸς κάκως c || 10 ποιήσεται] -σηται d 1. ἀνεπίδεκτον π. λόγων θ. κ. θ.] ‘altogether incapable of taking in the words of contemplation and theology,’ 2. μὴ ἐμφωλευέτω] from φωλεός ‘a den’; ‘let him not lurk in the ’ which Gr. imagines to clothe the base of the hill. 4. ἀθρόως] ’all at once’; explained by Suid. = ταχέχως: otherwise it would be in accordance with the etymology to understand it of the animal gathering itself up for the spring. Cp. § 21. ib. τ. ὑγιαίν. λόγους] 1 Tim. vi 3, 2 Tim. i 13. 5. ταῖς ἐπηρείαις] ‘abuse’; cp. ἐπηρεάζομεν above i 6. ib. ἔτι πόρρωθεν] a kind of com-parative= πορρωτέρω. Cp. v 5 μικρὸν ἄνωθεν. 8. στερροί] Cp. above i 3. 9. τοῖς ποικίλμασιν] Jer. xiii 23. ib. λέων...ὠρυόμενος] 1 Pet. v 8. 11. σῦς καταπατῶν] Matt, vii 6. 12. λύκος Ἀραβικός] Hab. i 8 (LXX.); cp. Zeph. iii 3. The words κ. ἀλλόφυλος (i.e. ‘or Philistine’) seem to be added to emphasize mystic interpretation of Ἀραβικός. 15. τοῖς καιροῖς κ. τ. χρείαις συμμ.] ‘shifting shape according to opportunities and necessities.’ 16. ἀμπελῶνες μ] Cant, ii 15 ἀλώπεκας μικροὺς ἀφανίζοντας ἀμπελῶνας. Gr. joins μικροὺς with ἀμπ. instead of ἀλώπ., understanding the sentence to denote the meanness of the ‘foxes’ (i.e. jackals), which did not venture to attack the large vineyeards, and spoiled the small ones instead.
footnote 3. 8 om μύσται καὶ d || 9 ἔτρεχον] εἶχον ac ‘ Reg. a tres Colb. Or. I ’ ǁ 10 ἀνῆλθον] ἀπῆλθον e 1. ὠμοβόρων] = ὠμηστής ‘devouring raw flesh,’ The Law does expressly forbid the eating of such animals on that ground; but it appears to be the reason for the prohibition of most of the birds enumerated in Lev. xi, Deut. xiv. 4. οὕτω] resumes the preceding clause—like sic demum; ’not it has got rid of these.’ ib. πλαξὶ...λιθίναις] Ex. xxiv 12. Α somewhat difficult turn in the application of the narrative. Gr., or rather his λόγος as identified with him, has ascended the mountain, with a view to having impressed upon him, or upon it, the teaching of God, as the Commandments were upon the tables of stone. The epithets στερραῖς κ. θ. are intended to convey the thought of something — no transient impression. 5. ἀμφοτέρωθεν] Ex. xxxii 15. Again a somewhat fantastic application. One side of the tables is seen—one part of the λόγος is —by every one; but there is a reverse which only few can read, viz. those who succeed in reaching the mountain top φθάνουσιν). This use of φθάνειν is familiar in the Ν. T. 3. When he has reached the appointed spot, he can only see the ‘back parts’ of God. 8. μύσται] Those who are initiated into the mysteries. 9. καταληψόμενος] ‘as if I were about to apprehend God.’ 11. διέσχον] ‘penetrated’: cf. Horn. Il. v 99 ἀντικρὺ δὲ διέσχε. Gr. uses it § 31 of penetrating through the veil of the Tabernacle. ib. ὕλης] ’matter.’ 12. συστραφείς] ‘having gathered myself up’: cp. Plat. Rep. 1 p. 336 συστρέψας ἑαυτὸν ὥσπερ θηρίον ἧκεν ἐφ’ ἡμᾶς. 13. τὰ ὀπίσθια] Ex. xxxiii 23. ib. τῇ πέτρᾳ σκεπασθείς] Ex. xxxiii 23 σκ. τῇ χειρί μου. This interpretation of the ‘ cleft in the rock,’ made familiar to Englishmen by ’s hymn, is very ancient. Cp. Iren. IV xx 9 ‘uidebit...in altitudine petrae, hoc est, in eo qui est secundum hominem eius aduentu,’ The Incarnation gives an assured point from which we may observe and study God, without being overwelmed by the greatness of the revelation. The glories of the Divine Nature are tempered for us, as it were, by the Human Life which encompasses us as we look out from it to the Divine. By the Incarnation, our field of contemplation is at once restricted and made clear.
footnote 1 om θέω acd ǁ 6 ὅσα] ὡς ‘Reg. a’ 1. διακύψας] ‘peering through the aperture,’ Εἶδον must be again before φύσιν. 2. τὴν πρώτην] In ref. to Ex. xxxiii 20 οὐ δυνήσῃ ἰδεῖν μου τὸ πρόσωπον. Ἀκήρατος practically, if not etymologically, = ἀκέραιος ‘pure,’ ‘unmixed.’ Cp. Arist. de Mundo ii 5 στοιχεῖον ἅκ. τε καὶ θεῖον. Gr. adds λ. δ. τῇ τριάδι lest he should suggest the Sabellian notion of a self-conscious Nature distinct from the Persons in whom it resides. 3. τ. πρώτου καταπ.] i.e. as reckoned from the seat of the Divine Presence, not as in Heb. ix 3 in the order of human approach. 4. ὁ. τ. χερουβὶμ σηκ.] It seems more natural to suppose that Gr. refers to the Cherubim covering the Mercy Seat (Ex. xxv 20 [19]), than to the decoration of the veil (Ex. xxvi 31). Cp. Ezek. xxviii 14, 16, where, however, there is nothing in most texts of the LXX. to represent ’covering.’ 5. τελευταία] to recall τὰ ὀπίσθια. Φθάνουσα as above. id. ἢ δέ] Gr. does not of course mean to distinguish sharply between the πρώτη and τελευταία φύσις, as if they were separate natures. He means the expressed and unexpressed parts or aspects of the same nature. The danger of misunderstanding is not felt in Greek, where words like πρῶτος, μέσος and the like, are commonly monly used in a partitive sense; e.g. ὁ πρῶτος ποὺς ’the front of the foot.’ 6. ὅσα ἐμὲ γινώσκειν] sc. πάρεστι. ib. ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ] sc. τοῦ θεοῦ, to be supplied from θεοῦ τὰ ὀπίσθια above. 8. μεγαλοπρέπεια] used of God nine times in the Pss.; μεγαλειότης is not. Prob. Gr. refers esp. to Ps. viii 2 (1), ciii (civ) 1 (in some texts), cx (cxi) 3, or cxliv (cxlv) 5, 12, where the word is used in connexion with God's works. Gr. prefers the word because it expresses Dot the abstract quality, like μεγαλειότης, but the impression produced by its manifesta-tion. 9. ὅσα μετ’ ἐκεῖνον ἐκ. γνωρ.] ‘all the indications of Himself which He has lift behind Him,’ Elias pares Wisd. xiii 5. 10. σαθραῖς ὄψεσι] Cp. i 3.
footnote 1 προσβλέπειν] βλέπειν ‘Reg. a’ || 3 Φαραω] του Φ. bdef ǁ 4 κατα τον Παυλον bef ǁ 5 ἐκεῖνον] -νους bef || 6 om ἠξιωμένος ac || 7 καν γαρ] om γὰρ a ǁ om τι e || 8 om ἤμων d || η καὶ] ἢ om καὶ f 4. 14 ἴνα καὶ] ἴνα τὸ b || 15 τὼ χαλεπὸν] τὸ χαλ. bd: τὼ suprascr. c || 16 om μεν c 2. ἀκραιφνεῖ]=ἀκεραίῳ ‘unmitigated,’ ‘untempered.’ 3. Φαραὼ θεός] Ex. vii 1. 4. κατὰ τὸν Παῦλον] 2 Cor. xii 2. Φθάσῃς as above. 10. ὑπεραίρει] used intransitively from Aristotle downwards. ib. κάτω βρίθοντος κρ.] Wisd. ix 15. For κράματος see i 7. 4. To form an adequate con-ception of God is even more impossible than to express it when formed. It is doubtful whether even angels can do it. 12. ἀρκτέον] from ἄρχεσθαι: ‘we must begin ’ The hopes with which he had begun at first ὡς θεὸν καταληψόμενος) have proved fallacious. 13. ὥς τις τῶν παρ᾿ Ἕ. θεολόγων] The reference appears to be to Timaeus 28 Ε τὸν μὲν οὖν ποιητὴν καὶ πατέρα τοῦ παντὸς εὑρεῖν τὸ ἔργον, καὶ εὕροντα εἰς πάντας ἀδύνατον λέγειν. No approval is conveyed by the expression θεολόγων τις. Cp. v 16. 14. οὐκ ἀτέχνως] Plato thus art-fully insinuates, in Gr.'s opinion, that he has himself apprehended what he says is so difficult to appre hend, and at the same time escapes exposure by saying that it is inexpressible τῷ (ἀνεκφρ.). 17. ἀδυνατώτερον] because if only the conception could be formed, expression would be comparatively easy. Cp. Novatian de Trin. § 4 nomen Dei edici non potest, quolacious. niam non potest nee concipi.
footnote 1 τάχα ἀν’] + καὶ e ǁ 4 καταβεβλακευμενοις] κατεβλ. acf ‘duo Colb. Or. 1’ || 6 γεννητὴ] γενητὴ abc || 11 p, τε c 1. εἰ καὶ μὴ μ., ἀλλ’ ἀμ’. γε] μετρίως is here a word of approbation, ‘if not satisfactorily, yet dimly at any rate.’ 4. μὴ ὅτι] ‘not to speak ’ cp. § 11. Καταβεβλ. from βλάξ, which is thought to be a collateral form of μαλακός, ‘slack,’ ‘enfeebled,’ ‘enervated.’ 6. γεννητῇ] not= γενητὴ ‘created,’ for Gr. goes on to speak of the higher created intelligences as a separate class afterwards; but strictly ‘begotten’ or ‘born,’ i.e. existing under physical conditions, the effect of which is described in the following clause. 7. ἐπιπροσθεῖ] The verb is formed from the adv. ἐπίπροσθεν: ‘to be in front of,’ so ‘get in the way of.’ Wyttenbach collects many instances of its use in his note on Plut. de Recta And. Ratione p. 41 C. ib. σαρκίον] the diminutive ex-presses depreciation. 8. πρός] ‘in reference to,’ it comes to a matter οf.’ ib. οὐκ οἴδα δέ, εἰ μὴ] of course indicates Gr.’s opinion that it is impossible. This was the general opinion. Cp. Chrys. Horn, de Incomprehensibili iii 1 τὸν ἀνεξιχνίαστον ἀγγέλοις, τὸν ἀνεξερεύνητον ἀρχαγγέλοις, τὸν ἀθέατον τοῖς σεραφίμ, τὸν ἀκατανόητον τοῖς χερουβίμ, τὸν ἀόρατον ἀρχαῖς καἰ ἐξουσίαις λαὶ δυνάμεσι καὶ ἁπλῶς πάση τῇ κτίσει. 10. τυχὸν ἂν καὶ τρανοῖντο] Τρανόω, a favourite word of Gr.'s, usually = ‘to make plain’ (e.g. § 20). as τρανός is sometimes used in the more active sense of ‘clear,’ i.e. of penetrating intelligence (e.g. Wisd. vii 22), it seems best to understand τρανοῖντο here in that way, ‘gifted with insight and intelligence.’ 12. ἐκτυπώτερον] ‘ more expressly,’ ’distinctly.’ 5. The works of God are beyond our present comprehension, much more Himself; we can only affirm for certain that He exists. 14. κείσθω] ‘be dropped.’ He not wish to pursue the question with regard to the superior intelligences: τὸ δὲ ἠμ’. ‘but as concerning us.’
footnote 5. 2 ἐν ἐπαγγελίαις ἐστιν d || 8 πάγιον] πανάγιον e || 10 om ταύτα φύσις . . . .λεγω δε d 1. ὑπερέχει π. νοῦν] Phil, iv 7. 3."/&gt; μήτε ὀφθ. ὁρατά κτλ.] 1 Cor. ii 9. Gr. forgets, as most people do, that St Paul adds ἡμῖν γὰρ ἀπεκάλυψεν ὁ θ. διὰ τοῦ πνεύματος. 4. κατὰ μικρὸν γοῦν] Γοῦν corrects, but limits the concession; ‘not contemplated by the mind— well, only to small estent.’ 6. τὰς σκιάς] ‘the outlines.’ ib. ὄψομαι κτλ.] Ps. viii 4 (3). 8. τ. ἐν αὐτ’. πάγιον λόγον] πάγιος from the root of πήγνυμι, ‘firm,’ ‘fixed’; ‘the well established order that prevails among them.’ words are a paraphrase of ‘which thou hast ordained.’ ib. ὀψόμενος δὲ ἐστιν ὅτε] Gr. calls attention to the fact that the Ps. uses the future, not the present. 9. ἢ ὑπὲρ τ....φύσις] ὑπερέχει πάντα νοῦν. It is a little odd to say, “note only the peace of God, but God Himself, passeth understanding.’’ We might have expected, ‘If the peace of God passeth understanding, much more God Himself.’’ 10. ἄληπτός τε κ.ἀπερίλ.] ‘inapprehensible as it is and incomprehensible.’ 11 οὐχ ὅτι ἐστιν, ἁλλ’ ἥτις ἐστίν] may be taken either with ἄληπτος κ. ἀπερίληπτος, or with the main verb ὑπερέχει π. νοῦν. Perh. the latter is the more forcible: ‘Ι do not mean that the fact of its existence passes understanding, but the nature of it.’ ib. οὐ γὰρ κενόν κτλ.] 1 Cor. xv 14, 17. The γὰρ implies that it would be ‘vain’ if we were unable truly to apprehend the fact of God's existence. 13. ὃ δογματίζομεν] ‘nor is that the doctrine which I am laying down.’ ib. εὐγνωμοσύνην] Cp. εὐγνώμονος above, i 5. It resembles ἐπιείκεια, ‘reasonableness.’ Μὴ πάλιν, cp. i 4 μὴ πάλιν ἐπιφυέσθωσαν. 14. κατεπαρθῇς] ‘exalt yourself against me.’ Cp. Cyr. Al. c. Ful. i p. 6.
footnote 6. 4 αἰτίαν] οὐσίαν f ǁ 6 ὁδεύουσι] -σα c 6. Of His existence the order of nature assures us. We are forced to think of a Creator when we look upon Creation, as the sight of a lyre makes us think of the lyre-maker. But beyond that, we have no certainty. 4. συνεκτικήν] from συνέχειν, Δ’ maintain in harmony’: cp. Col. i τὰ πάντα ἐν αὐτῷ συνέστηκεν. So Xen. Cyrop. 8 p. 140 οἱ θεοὶ] τὴν τῶν ὅλων τήνδε τάξιν συνέχουσιν ἀτριβῆ. For the construction, τὴν π. π. αἰτίαν is strictly (with θεόν) the subject of εἶναι. The def. art. is used in the same way as in participial sentences like εἰσὶν...οἱ τ. ἀκ. προσκνώμενοι (above, p. 1); where our idiom rather puts ’a’ than ‘the’; ‘that there is a God and a creative cause.’ 5. ὁ φυσικὸς νόμος] Gr. does not here mean ‘natural law’ in modern sense, although such an use might readily be paralleled. The explanatory clause below shews that he does not mean ‘the law which we observe in the natural order around us,’ but the natural upon ourselves of the observations which we make. Cp. below ταῖς φυσικαῖς ἀποδείξεσιν. ib. προσβάλλουσα] ‘lighting upon.’ 6. κ. πεπηγόσι] πέπηγα (from πήγνυμι) has the intrans. sense, ‘to be fixed.’ K. πεπ. κ. ὁδ’. κ. κιν. κ. are predicates of τοῖς ὁρ.; ‘seeing them fixed’ ect. 8. συλλογιζόμενος] When we see the order in nature the natural result upon ourselves is to infer the existence of an ἀρχηγός i.e. ‘author.’ 10. οὐσιώσαντος] οὐσιόω=‘to give οὐσία,’ ‘bring into being.’ 11. κιθάραν...κάιλιστα ἠσκημένην] Cp. Paley's famous argument about the watch. Ἀσκεῖν like ἐξασκεῖν, = exornare; see Horn. Od. i 439: ‘beautifully and elaborately made.’ 15. ταῖς ὄψεσιν] contrasted with τῆ διανοίᾳ: ‘he will pass ἀναδ. because higher up, further back, in the order of thought or causation) to him in thought, although he may not be acquainted with him by sight.’ The unusual pl. ταῖς ὄψ. might mean either ‘by his (the player's) looks,’ or ‘by his (the hearer's) sight.’ latter makes the best parallel to διαν.; it is also used in this sense by Herodian 6 (9, 10) ὡς ἐν ὄψεσιν ἢν ’when he came in sight.’
footnote 6 om ποτε ‘Or. 1’ 1. τὸ ποιητ δῆλον] ‘the creating power is plain.’ 2. ἀγνώμων] here ‘unreasonable,’ ‘deficient in sense.’ 3. κ. ταῖς φ. ἐπ’. ἀποδ.] The καὶ joins ἑπόμενος to ἑκουσίως, not to προίων. 4. ἀλλ’ οὐδὲ τοῦτο] a very difficult passage. The usual interpretation makes ἀλλὰ answer to the μὴ in μὴ προιών, ‘who will not go as far as this, but (says) that not even this, which we have imagined, is God.’ But it is harsh to supply the necessary φάσκων or ὁμολογῶν in order to make the clause grammatical; and a comparison with the sentence in § 12 where Gr. resumes his thread after a long digression, seems to shew that we must assign an entirely different meaning to the present sentence,—and which will accord better with grammatical requirements. In ἑ 12 Gr. says that the proposition from which he had started was τὸ μὴ ληπτὸν εἶναι ἀνθρωπίνη διανοίᾳ τὸ θεῖον, μηδὲ ὅλον ὅσον ἐστὶ φαντάζεσθαι. Here, accordingly, we must suppose, that it is Gr. himself, and not the λίαν ἀγνώμων, who denies εἶναι θεὸν ὅπερ ἔφαντ’. It is, he says, very unreasonable not to accept the natural proofs of God's existence, and in following them we are compelled to form certain great outlines of a conception of God (e.g. creative power, rational method, etc.), which we cannot doubt to be correct. But even this is not the same thing as to identify εἶναι ὅπερ) God with what we have imagined, or figured to ourselves, or what our reason has delineated. τοῦτο is the subject of ἐστὶν understood, of which εἶναι θ. κτλ. is the predicate. While we have ἀποδείξεις for the one belief, we have none for the other. 5. ὑπέγραψεν] Cp. I Pet. ii 21 ὑπογραμμόν ‘a sketch.’ 6. ἐν περινοίᾳ τ....ἐγένετο] Gr. uses the same expression in Or. xlv § 11: οὐ γὰρ οἶόν τε ἄλλως ἐν περινοίᾳ θεοῦ γενέσθαι σώματος ὑλικοῦ καὶ δεσμίου νοῦ πάχος μὴ βοηθούμενον. The rare word περίνοια appears to denote an embracing in thought, a mental taking in of the subject. Τούτου sc. θεοῦ ‘If ever anyone in any degree has attained to an understanding of Him, what proof is there of the fact?’ 8. τὸ στόμα...πνεῦμα] Ps. cxviii (cxix) 131. The ἵνα ὥστε, following as it does upon the οὕτως and the τοσούτου.

Metaph. xii 7. 4. πολιτεία τ. ὑψηλοῦ] ‘all a high-minded man's life.’ 7. to begin with, God cannot be corporeal; which would involve being dissoluble. 6. ὅλαις τ. λου....ἐφόδοις] The reading ὅλως (‘if you rely at all’) would not make so strong an argu-ment against Eunomian self-confidence.

The component elements might conceivably be separated and yet something remain; but λ. would be the complete break up of the whole thing. ib. σύνθεσις] The blending of different elements introduces a possibility of conflict, and so of division, and so of destruction; which is unthinkable in connexion with Him who, if He exists at all, must be the πρώτη φύσις, or primary existence, into which no earlierexistence enters. Elias observes that the ‘Platonic’ form of the argument is particularly applicable to the heretical dialecticians whom Gr. has in view. 5. ἐκ τῶν τελ.] In other words, the contention that God is not ‘a body’ is proved by a reductio absurdum. 8. Besides, if God were corporeal, His corporeity must involve either the denial of all other corporeities, or His interpenetration with them. Even on the supposition of a ‘fifth element’ which might be identified with His corporeity, He would be made subject to motion and to space. 8. τὸ Οὐχί] Jer. xxiii 24. 9. πνεῦμα κ.] Wisd. i. 7. The book is treated as authoritative. 10. τὸ μὲν...τὸ δέ] It seems logically best, if grammatically less obvious, to take τὸ μὲν as the direct ace. after περιγράφοι and τὸ δὲ as the indirect ace. after περιγράφοιτο; ‘if God should circumscribeonething and be circumscribed with another.’ This, it is assumed, must be the case if God were ‘a body.’ 11. ἢ γάρ] as often, ‘for otherwise either’etc. ib. διὰ κενοῦ...τ. παντός] ‘the universe which He pervades must be empty.’ 12. ἵν’ ὑβρισθῇ] an answer to the implied rhetorical question, ‘And why must everything perish?’ order that God may be doubly outraged, by being made a body, and by being deprived of all that He has created.’ 14. ἀδύνατον] because ‘bodies’ are mutually exclusive.
footnote 2 τέμνει] τέμει c || 3 γραωδέστερον] + ὡς οἱ πέρι ταύτα ἐσχολακότες εληρησαν bde El ǁ 9 διοίσομαι] μεν ‘Reg. a’ ib. πλακήσεται κτλ.] πλακ. from πλέκω ‘to weave,’ so ‘entangle,’ It is a somewhat strange use of the simple verb; but Gr. has elsewhere θεῷ πλακῆναι καἰ θεὸν γενέσθαι ἐκ τῆς μίξεως. Ἀντιπ. ‘bring into juxtaposition.’ Gr. understands by the two words is explained by the comparison with mixing liquids. 1. τὸ μὲν τέμνει] sc. ὁ θεός; the fut. τμηθ. shews that Gr. is no longer thinking of the liquids, though no doubt it was the comparison with them which caused the pres. τέμνει. The supposed interpenetration of the σῶμα of God with other σώματα necessitates constant breaches of continuity in both. 2. Ἐπικ. ἀτόμων] Cp. p. 19 above. 3. γραωδέστερον] Cp. 1 Tim. iv 7. The words which follow in some authorities must be an ancient gloss. If they belonged to the text at all, they must needs come in after τμηθήσεται, where (apparently) no MS. places them. ib. διαπεσεῖται] ‘fall through,’ ‘come to ’; Plat. Phaed. 80 c. The subject of διαπ. is ὁ π. τ σ. λόγος. 4. σῶμα οὐχ νεῖ] It is difficult in English to keep up the play on the word σῶμα. Gr. means of course that the argument for a corporeal existence of God proves unsubstantail: it has no πῆξιν, ‘solidity’ (cp. πάγιος λόγος in § 5). 5. εἰ δὲ ἄυλον] ἁ priv. and ὕλη. The protasis is broken up into εἰ μὲν τὸ πέμπτον and εἰ δὲ ἄλλο τι παρὰ τὸ πέμπτον. Then the first apodosis is broken up likewise into ἒστω μέν and κατὰ τί δέ. ib τὸ πέμπτον] The reference is to the Aristotelian conception of a “quintessence,” or fifth “element,” besides earth, air, fire and water. Cp. Bas. Hex. 11. 7. ἔστω μέν] Gr. is willing to assume for the moment that there is such a thing as the imagined quintessence: οὐδὲν νῦν διοίσομαι, ‘I will not now differ.’ 8. κατὰ τὴν αὐτόνομον κτλ.] Almost each word here requires annotation. Λόγος is ‘the σῶμα,’ or perhaps ἀσώματον σῶμα Φορὰν at first sight seems to refer to τὴν κύκλῳ φ. just above; but there is prob. no such play upon the word intended. Gr. seems to employ it in the sense of ‘usage.’ Although no other example of the subst. in that sense is at hand, the verb is not infrequently so used. Gr. has διὰ γλώσσης φέρειν ‘to speak of. Ἀναπλάττειν and its derivatives are frequent in Gr. Sometimes the prep. has its full force, ‘re-construction,’ ‘fashioning afresh,’ as for ex. baptism; sometimes it is simply ‘to fashion,’ ‘imagine.’ Thus he of matter ὕλην) as ὑποστᾶσαν ἐξ οὐκ ὄντων, κἄν τινες ἀγέννητον ἀναπλάττωσιν. So here he seems to mean the ‘shaping’ which the Aristotelians put upon the word, with a slight suggestion of its being a factitious and not the legitimate construction. This is further expressed by calling it αὐτόνομον, ‘their inderpendent,’ arbitrary, ‘use and construction of the word.’

Or. 1’ 1. κατὰ τί] Gr. seems to mean ’in what respect,’ ‘by virtue what part of its being, will this πέμπτον, which is identified with the σῶμα of God, take its place among the things which move and revolve?’ It is, however, he a ὕβρις, a wanton affront, to assign such a place to God at all, whatever may be the answer to his question. 4. δώσουσι] ‘will grant’: sc. that God is ὁ φέρων. ib. τί δὲ τὸ τοῦτο π. κινοῦν] τοῦτο =τὸ πέμπτον: it (viz. God) moves other things, and itself moves with them; what then moves it? The τὸ πᾶν which follows will then include the thing which sets τὸ πέμπτον in motion. 6. ἐν τόπῳ] Motion is a change of space- relations, and therefore implies a local position. 7. εἰ δὲ ἄλλο τι] The other alternative (viz. that the σῶμα of God is not the πέμπτον) is again confronted with a dilemma; εἰ μὲν ἀγγελ., εἰ δὲ ὑπὲρ ταῦτα. 8. πόθεν ὅτι] ’xvhence comes the belief ’ ’how do they know that?’ ib. πδσον...εἴη] In better Greek there would of course be an ἄν: ‘how far far would God excel an angel? 10. εἰσήχθη] The aor. gives a liveliness to the argument: the logical consequences are represented as having taken actual effect; as in i 2. id. ἐσμός] ‘a swarm,’ said to derived from ἵημι. Ἀλόγιστος= ‘innumerable,’ though its possible sense of ‘irrational’ may perh. have suggested to Gr. the ’abyss of nonsense’ which follows. Στῆναι, ‘to stop.’ is not clear why the notion that God's (supposed) σῶμα is superior to angelic bodies should ‘again introduce a countless swarm of bodies. Perhaps by πάλιν. only means that this notion is in that respect no better than the former one, because it also implies that the angels have bodies. Otherwise he must mean that the supposition of a body far superior to angelic bodies leaves room for the invention of swarms of intermediate bodies between the angelic bodies and it.

The sense is, ‘What substantive element is it in God's being, what light does it throw upon His nature and underlying essence, to say that He has no beginning,’ etc.? Ὑπόστασις is used in its older, untechnical sense, ‘person,’ but ’substance,’ as in Heb. i 3. 9. ἐξίστασθαι...περατοῦσθαι] Ἐξίστ. ‘to be moved out of oneself, so to change: Plat.

Cyril Jer. uses it of God (Procat. § 2). The τοῦ ὄντος does not specially refer to God (ὁ ὤν), but quite generally to any existing thing which is under discussion. 8. ἀπειπεῖν] ‘to reject,’ ‘deny.’ ib. ἵνα ἔκ τε] depends on δεὸ. ib. ὧν οὔκ ἐστι] by attraction for τούτων ἃ οὐκ ἑ. ; so directly after, τῆς οὗ ἐστὶ θ. for τῆς τούτου ὅ ἐστι. 11. τὰ πέντε δὶς ὅσα ἑ.] ‘how many twice five is.’ 13. τῶν ἐντὸς δεκάδος ἢ δ. ἀ.] ‘of the numbers below ten or between the multiples of ten.’ 15. ἐρείδοL . . . εἰd] ‘satisfy . . . with’; lit. ‘plant firmly . . . upon.’ 19. ἤ] This elliptical and idio-matic use of ἤ suggests the alternative, ‘deny this if you can; or let us take it as self-evident and pass on.’ The μὲν is strictly answered by ἐπεὶ δέ, and there ought not to be such a break between them as is indicated by the usual division of chapters.
footnote 10. 3 τις ἀν’] om ἀν’ d ΙΙ 7 η τινι] ἐν τινι e || 10 μέλλοι] -λει d 10. Gr. makes a digression to enquire how God is related to space. 2. ἐστιν ὅπου] ‘somewhere,’ like ἐστιν ὧν in i 5. 3. πῶς ἂν καἰ εἴη] ‘how it can exist at all.’ 5. πάντως ἐπείπερ ἐστὶν ἢ... ἤ] ‘it must of course be because it is either ...or.’ 7. ἤ τινι, ἢ πανταχοῦ] ‘it must reside either in α section of the universe, or extending throughout the whole: The passage which follows is characterized by Gr. himself (in § 11) as σκολιὸν γριφοειδές. Editors, therefore, and translators may be excused if they have made nonsense of it by wrong punctuation and by impossible renderings. The drift, however, is plain enough. Gr. places his opponent in a dilemma. If the Divine Being is located in a section of the universe, it is circumscribed by something relatively small τοῦ τινός=the supposed section, ἐλάττονος in comparison with τὸ πᾶν); a notion which is manifestly absurd. If on the other hand it is located in the universe at large, yet still (ex hypothesi) within the universe, then, though the thing which circumscribes it is relatively great πλ. καὶ ἄλλου πολλοῦ=‘greater than other great things’), yet none less it is as much circumscribed as in the former case. This follows from the very statement that τὸ θεῖον is ‘in’ the universe, which at once involves the relation of the thing containing to the thing contpined (grammatically τὸ περιεχόμενον is in apposition to the subject of περιγραφήσεται, and τοῦ περιέχοντος to ἐλάττονος τοῦ τινός and to πλείονος respectively). To complete the argument, however, it is necessary to postulate εἰ...μέλλοι) that the universe is not positively infinite but contained within itself if within nothing else, and that as it consists of space-relations it cannot he exempt from the possibility of circumscription. (The grammar of the last clause is apparently irregular, and some word like χρὴ must be supplied from μέλλοι; but it is possible that Gr. intends μέλλοι to stand absolutely and impersonally in both clauses (=‘it is to be a ’), making τό πᾶν περισχ. ace. and inf., like μ. τόπον εἶναι).
footnote 2 ει δε] ουδ e || 5 η] ει f || 9 om εἰ ‘Reg.

The past tense ἦν, ἐνοήθη) in the preg-nant Greek idiom refers back to the moment when the opponent is supposed to have adopted the con-clusion. 3. τὸ ὑπὲρ τοῦτο] i.e. ὑπὲρ τὸ πᾶν. 4. τὸ ὑπεραῖρον κ. ὒ.] ὑπεραίρειν ‘to transcend’ (cp. § 3) represents εἶναι ὑπὲρ τὸ πᾶν. The single art., not repeated before ὑπεραιρόμενον, shews, of course, that the difficulty lies not in conceiving of the two things themselves, but in conceiving their relation to each other. 5. ἢ χρή] In English we say, ’Must there not be?’; in Greek there any alternative,) or must there be?’ 6. καὶ ᾧ π.] Καὶ here adds another description of τὸ μέσον, not a separate thing; and in τὸ μ. the art. is used as in τὸ διορίζον just above. 7. τοῦτο] sc. τὸ μέσον. 8. ἐφύγομεν] when we asked ποῦ τὸ ὑπὲρ τὸ πᾶν]. ib. καὶ οὔπω λοῶ κτλ.] ‘And I do not now insist upon the fact that τὸ π. εἶναι).’ 9. ἐν γάρ] ’for comprehension is one form of circumscription.’ 11 The purpose of the digression was to exemplify the barren dialectic of the Eunomians, as well as to shew that God is incomprehensible. He is so, not because He grudges the knowledge to man, whom He loves. 14. γριφοειδές] from γρῖφος, ‘a crab-pot,’ and so ‘a conundrum.’ is a hit at the Eunomian style of argument. ib. ὡς]=ὥστε. The tree is known by its fruits (Matt, vii 20) and the absence of light among the Eunomian theologians by the obscurity of their language.

Gr. uses it here to bring out the notion of dissipation inseparable from utterance. He shrinks however from saying ‘dissolved,’ ‘persihsing’ λυόμ.), because, although the sound comes to an end, there is a sense in which the ‘word’ remains. What Gr. means by λυόμενον is made clear by iv 17 λυομένη φωνῇ. 5. τὴν ἕξιν, κ. τ. ἐν τ. θεωρ.] Wisdom can only be conceived of as a ‘habit’ (the Aristotelian word) of some personal subject, and occupied upon some object. It cannot be conceived of as isolated and self-existent. 7. διαθέσεις] In the same way ‘righteousness,’ ‘love,’ are ‘dispositions’ of a person, not abstract things; and for us they derive their meaning from a contrast with their opposites. Tey are, moreover, constantly changing, and the subject in which they reside varies ac-cordingly. 11. τούτων ἀποστ.] The ταῦτα must mean the relative notions which Gr. has shewn to be inseparable from the προσηγορίαι which he has discussed. He cannot mean the προσηγ. themselves, because he goes on to use them as εἰκάσματα. In the next sentence τούτων = τῶν εἰκασ-μάτων.

We, on the other hand, are led by reason to worship, not nature, but the Author of nature and its wonderful order. 4. ὁ λόγος] ‘reason.’ When Rea-son is said to have taken us in hand, Gr. means both the reasonable in-struction given by the Church, and our own reasonable reflexion upon it. It is, of course, contrasted with ὁ πονηρός of the previous section. 6. προσβάλλων] intrans., as in § 6. ib. κ. τοῖς ἀπαρχῆς ἐντ.] Passing over the more ephemeral objects, its attention was arrested by those which are coeval with creation, like sun and moon: but it did not allow us to stop ἔστησεν) there. Μέχρι as in ἑ 9. We should have expected οὐδὲ μ.; if οὔτε is right, Gr. must intend to connect the clause closely with κα διὰ τούτων. 8. κάτα τὴν αἴσθ.] things as much subject to the senses as we are. 10. περίεστιν] ‘they still exist’; or perhaps, ‘they have existence in abundance’; cp. § 25. 11. δι’ ἀέρος] sc. φέρεται. Καθ’ ὕδατος sc. ἐστίν, ’under the water’; like κατὰ γῆς ’underground’: cp. § 24. 13. τίς ἡ κοινωνία] If this is the right reading, of course it is ‘what is this partnership?’ i.e. came it? If we read τίς κ., κοίν’. κ. συμφ. κ. συμπν. must be in ap-position to the τίς before ἔμιξε, ‘who combined and distributed them? what partnership and union and concord between them? 15. τὸν εἰρηκότα] ‘him who said it: There is no reason to think that the words which follow are a direct quotation. Nor indeed are the foregoing, but they seem more likely to have had their origin in a reminiscence of something that Gr. had read than the comparatively colourless words which follow. It is harder, however, to say, whom Gr. means by τὸν εἰρ. Elias refers to Oppian Halieut. i 412 οἵῃ σὺν φιλό-διακρίνας ἐκέδασσας αἰθέρα τε, κτλ. Jahn prefers Plato Tim. 35 A foil. The resemblance is not very close; but in Τἰm. 32 c occur words which come somewhat nearer. The ‘body of the world,’ Plato there says, was formed of the various elements δι’ ἀναλογίας ὁμολογῆσαν, φιλίαν τε ἔσχεν...εἰς ταὐτὸν αὑτῷ ξυνελθόν. Perh. Opp. comes the nearer to Gr's language.

Hereafter we shall know as we are known; here, the most privileged attain to a knowledge which is only relatively great. 15. ἀλλ’ εἰ μέν] but whether man will ever find.’ 19. τῷ οἰκείῳ] ‘with that to wh it belongs’: Vaughan's ‘spirits fair kindred ’ Cp. § 12 sub fin.

Even to call upon His name was beyond the present powers of Enos: he only succeeded τὸ κατορθ.) in hoping to do it. Ἐπικ. is of course active in meaning. 11. μετετέθη] Gen. v 24; cp. Wisd. iv 10. This implied high favour with God μέν), but it did not of itself prove οὔπω) that E. had either attained, or would ever attain, an adequate knowledge the time the divine nature. 13. εὐαρέστησις] Gen. vi9 Kαλόν, constr. like triste lupus stabulis. 14. δίας. πιστευθέντος] ‘entrusted with the duty of saving.’ 15. ἐδικαιώθη] Gen. xv 6. 16. θυσίαν θυσίαν Gen. xxii 13. ‘Strange,’ because miraculously supplied. It is prob. that Gr. means the ram, rather than Isaac; for Basil also makes the ram a type of Christ (de Spir. S. 14, p. 319 D). 18. ἔθρεψε] Gen. xviii 8. Although the detail is taken only from ’s history, the restriction is intended to apply also to Noe. ib. ἐπῃνέθη] Perh. Gen. xviii 17 foil.

On the other hand τοῦ ὀφθ. seems more like a reminiscence of Gen. xxxv 1,9 (in u. 7 the word is ἐπεφάνη); and perh. it might have been more natural to mention the name of Penuel after the mention of the wrestling. 6. ἥτις π. ἐ.] The whole clause forms a cogn. ace. after προσπαλ., ‘wrestles whatever wrestling that of God with man may be.’ 7. ἢ τάχα] ‘or perhaps (it would be best to say) the trial,’ etc. He this turn, because God was not ’wrestling’ for the mastery, but to try the ἀρετή of Jacob. 8. σύμβολα] Gen. xxxii 31 (32). 12. ἐκεῖνο δέ] refers to what follows, lows, ὅτι θ. φύσιν κτλ.

Elias, Esaias, Ezekiel, and others, were unable to receive the revelation of the Divine nature in itself. 16. ἢ αὔρα τις ὁ] 1 Kings xix 12 φωνὴ αὔρας λεπτῆς. The τις hints that there was something more than usual in ‘that breeze.’ Gr.’s agrument implies that if the presence had been discerned in the mightier movements of nature, God might have been thought to manifest self wholly in them, but that it was impossible to imagine this in connexion with the ‘small breeze.’

It is indeed possible that he understood πρόσωπον, πόδας, in Isaiah, to be those of the Lord.’ ib. ἑαυτόν τε] ‘and saw himself.’ 18. τὸ ὄχημα] Ezek. i 4.

Ὑπόστ. is ‘an establishment’ of some kind; in 2 Sam. xxiii 14 of ‘a garri-son’; in Jer. prob. ‘a court,’ or ‘familiar circle.’ Gr. however curiously misunderstood the word to = ὑπόστασις in the sense of οὐσία (cp. § 9). 20.

He calls it a πρόοδος to signify that it represented a progress in St P.'s spiritual experience, and not merely an incidental privilege. Cp. v 26. 13. etirtp τοῦτο] Gr. will not even admit that we can be sure that St P. thereby became acquainted with the Divine nature.

By a strange oversight, Gr. confounds the Forerunner with the Divine. φωνή, perh. with ref. to John i 23. 10. διωρίζετο] ‘to define’; so ‘to affirm.’ 21. All abstract ruth is hard to attain with such instruments as we possess, but above all the truth about God. So Solomon and St Panl confessed; and David, who despaired of knowing even himself. 14. προσβάλλοντες] Cp. § 16.

Orac. (11 438 D) has the expression ὡς ἔχοντα πολλὰς ἀντιλήψεις καὶ ὑπονοίας πρὸς τοὐναντίον.

Καθ’ ἑαυτόν might be (as in § 19) ‘after his pattern’; but the connexion is in favour of ‘in his time.’ 7. καρδίας πλάτος] 1 Kings iv 29 (iv 25 Swete). Sw. reads χύμα καρδίας; and Gr.'s χύσις directly after seems to show that he read the same, πλάτος being his interpretation. Χύσις, ‘spread,’ ‘expanse.’ 9. ἰλιγγιᾷ] ‘reels.’ ib. τέλος τι π. σοφίας] ‘makes it as it were the end (perfection) of wisdom to find henv far it ὁ περὶ θ. λόγος) has escaped him.’ Gr. refers to such passages as Eccl. vii 23 foll., viii 17, and perh. xii 12 foll. 13. κριμάτων] Rom. xi 33. ib. στάσιν τῆς ἀν.] ‘that the ascent never stops,’ i.e. is endless. 15. ἀεί τινος ὑποφ. τ. λ.] lit. ‘something remaining ever dimly disclosing itself.’ 16. ἴνα κ. αὐτός] By his exclamation, Gr. has dramatically put himself beside St P. 17. περιγράφει τὸν λ.] ‘He concludes his discourse with astonishment.’

By ἕδρα Gr. seems to mean the ‘bottom.’ 5. τεθαυμ] Ps. exxxviii (exxxix) 6. ‘That That the knowledge even of his own constitution was too wonderful for him.’ It is possible, however, that Gr. misunderstood the ἐξ to mean that it was the contemplation of his constitution which made the knowledge of God seem overwhelming. 6. κεκρατ.] ibid. ἐκραταιώθη, οὐ μὴ δύνωμαι πρὸς αὐτήν. Περίδρ., ‘grasp.’ 22. Well might David despair; for how marvellous is man's constitutuion,—his birth, his sustenance, his instincts, his continuity, his very organs and the media in which they act, a microcosm in himself. 8. φησι] sc. David. 11. κάτω ῥέω] by decay and death: ἄνω φ., prob. Gr. means by contemveys. ib. ψυχή] without the art., points the contrast between the nature of the soul and its limitations. Περιγράφεται, because confined in the body; 12. ζωὴν δίδ] sc. to the body; and yet it receives from the body a share in its πάθη. 13. ἀόριστος] Though our intelligence works within limits, those limits are themselves capable of indifinite extension. 14. ἐφοδεύων] ‘visiting.’ 15. δι’ ἀέρος χ.] Perh. by means of speech. 16. μετὰ τῶν πρ.] Intelligence ‘enters in with the things us, because we learn by them. is further expressed by αἰσθ. κοιν.; it is ’in partnership with sense,’ though capable of withdrawing itself from the senses.

Αὐτομάτως, ‘instinctively.’ 7. ὁλκὴ] ‘attraction,’ from ἕλκειν. Ἵνα is not used here in a ‘final’ sense. Cp. § 7. 8. ουνέχηται] sc τὰ γεννῶντα κ. τὰ γεννώμενα. 9. etSrj] ’forms.’ How, Gr. asks, is the common form so constant while appearing with such a variety of distinguishing features; and in all that variety the peculiarities of each individual remain untouched, so that no two men are exactly alike? 11. τὸ αὐτὸ ζῶον] ‘animal’ for ‘kind of animal’; as we talk of ’the ’ ’the ’ Gr. is speaking of the deathless persistence of the species, not of the restored existence of the specimen. His wonder is that the type endures. It never passes into another ζῶον. Μετα-στάσει, ‘removal’ by death. 12. ὑπεξῆλθε] gnomic aor. 13. ὁλκῷ] There seems to be no instance of ὁλκός=ὁλκή, which might mean the flow or current of the river. Suidas gives an interpretation ὁδὸς ἢ ἀγωγὸς ῥεύματος, and quotes the phrase rbv ὁλκὸν τοῦ ὕδατος ἔκοψεν. Here then it would mean ‘as in the channel of a river, which (river) never stands still, yet is ever there.’ This is in accordance with the common meaning of ὁ. = sulcus.

Sight acts, in Gr. 's opinion, as swiftly as will and thought. 11. παραδοχαί] From the addi tion of τινές, we see that the word bore some half-technical sense, of which the Lexica do not speak. Prob. δοχαί, ὑποδοχαί, ‘receptacles.’ 12. λόγῳ μὴ θεωρ.] Gr. seems to mean that the senses, which are so hospitable to the things external to ourselves, are yet a mystery imorgans, penetrable to the reason which resides within us. 14. μνήμης . . . ἀναμνήσεως] μν. is the faculty, ἀνάμν. the act of re-membering. There is a treatise of Aristotle bearing the title περὶ μνή-μὴς καὶ ἀναμνήσεως, which doubtless Gr. has in mind. 15. ὁ μικρὸς οὗτος κ.] On man as a microcosm, see Plat. Tim. 81 Α and 88 D. These passages have been kindly pointed out to me by Mr Archer-Hind, who adds, “No-thing like the phrase occurs, but the conception is plainly there." He thinks it far from improbable that Proclus, whose commentary on this part of the Tim. has not been pre-served, may have applied the term μικρὸς κόσμος to the human body; or that some Stoic writer so applied it.

Isocrates advises a man to be φιλόκαλος in regard to his dress, but not καλλωπιστής, which he says would be περίεργον. Ἀκαλ-λώπ. cannot mean ‘unadorned, which would be no antithesis to Φιλόκ., but ‘not given to adorning themselves.’

Gr. treats the τέττιξ as if it were a bird. 16. τερετίσματα] ‘chirping.' Γᾶ μεσημβρ. sc. μουσουρΥήματα. 18. παραπέμπωσι] ‘escort.' 20. τὸ σύριγμα] ’ turns his hissing into a melody.’ 21. τὰς βιαίους φ.] ’forced notes'; i.e. the unnatural sounds made by birds which are taught to speak and to whistle.

footnote 4. τὸ πτερόν] seems to mean ‘his plumage,’ not ‘wing,’ as above. So Philostratus says of the peacock, τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς τοῦ πτεροῦ τὴν τῶν ἄστρων διακόσμησιν ἀναπλάττεται. Kατάστερον from κατά and ἀστήρ. 6. θεατρίζει] a favourite word of Gr.’s, but not very common elsewhere, ‘to show off,’ as upon the stage; cp. Heb. x 33. Σοβαρός, ‘pompous.’ 8. καὶ γυναικῶν] Job xxxviii 36 (LXX.). If such skill is wonderful in women, much more in creatures without reason, like the foll. 25. The sagacity of animals ; the bee, the spider, the crane, the ant. 13. καλιαί] ‘bowers’; a poetical word for ‘nests.’ It is a somewhat bold phrase to say that they make rocks and trees their nests. Ἐξησκ., cp. § 6 ἠσκ. 18. ἑξ. συρ. κ. ἀντιστρ.] ‘by means of hexagonal pipes complementary to each other, and the fabric secured (lit. the firmness is effected) by means of the dividing wall and the combi-nation ὁ the angles with the straight lines.' The ’dividing ’ is perh. the horizontal one between the upper and lower set of cells. But cp. Bas. Hex. viii p. 88 (Paris 1638).

Υρ. ταῖς οὐκ οὔσαις] ’ivith his imaginary limes.’ 8. τίνος Παλ. κτλ.] Παλ. depends upon τακτικά; τακτικά is nom. to ἐμιμήσατο understood, and κιν. κ. σχ. acc after it. The same verb must be supplied for ποῖοι Φειδίαι etc. Ὥς φασι implies (as in ἑ 24) that Gr. himself had not had opportunities of observing the crane and the peacock. The usual reading ταῦτα παιδ’. can only make sense, if at all, if κ. ταῦτα be taken as in § 19, ’and that, when they move': ταὐτά makes good sense, and the καὶ before it points on to καὶ μετὰ ποικ. ‘What Pal. drew up tactics to rival the movements and groupings of the cranes, which, so they tell us, without breaking rank go through the same drill- like movements, in ever so many figures of flight?’ 12. γράφειν κ. πλάττειν] Phidias πλάττειν, the rest γράφειν ᾔδεσαν. 13. Κνώσσιος] at Cnossus, or Gnossus, in Crete; νύμφῃ, Ariadne, see Homer II. xviii 592 foil. 15. δυσέλικτος] ‘hard to unwind.' Gr. apologizes for using so poetical a word. 16. ἀπαντῶν] ‘meeting.'

Plants, stones, earth, and its springs—its medicinal waters—are full of wonders ; the stability of the earth, its adaptation of mountain and plain to the convenience of its inhabitants. 6. τῆς ἐν φύλλοις φιλ.] ‘the artistic skill displayed in the leaves.’ They are ‘profitable to the fruits’ by shading them, as Elias says. Cp. Bas.

The point pern, lies in the plur.; ‘the charms of the colours and their varieties of quality.’ 13. πανδαισίᾳ] ‘α perfect feast,’ from δαίς. 15. εὐεργετῇ] 2nd per. sing. pres. ind. pass. 18. ἀλλ. κ. τῇ γῇ συνδ.] It is hard to see what Gr. means by this expression. The bays may be said to be connected with the land by the way they run up into it and affect its whole character. Gr. is no doubt thinking of the deeply indented coast of the Aegean. They are con-nected with each other, apparently, because the coasting vessels pass along from bay to bay, rounding the headlands, and plying between the towns that lie in the gulfs. Cp. ἑ 27.

Σήραγγες are ’holes? ’passages, Gr.'s theory of hot springs is that the water is heated by the violence with which it is forced out of its underground pas-sages, by blasts of air which it en-counters. These dash it from side to side and drive it with intense pressure through narrow apertures, until it assumes a very high temperature ἐκπυρούμεναι). Ὅπη παρείκοι, ‘wherever possuble.' I do not know whence Gr. obtained this theory. It is not in Arist. Meteor. or de Mnndo, although Arist. has much to say about underground currents of wind, as well as of underground streams. Arist. rightly connects hot springs with volcanic action. But cp. Bas. Hex. iv ἐκ τῆς αὐτῆς τοῦ κινοῦντος αἰτίας ζέουσα γίνεται... καὶ πυρώδης. 8. μ. τ. ἐναντίας δ.] generally understood to mean ’along with the ’ This is of course an impossible interp. of the words. The μετὰ is, as frequently in Gr., used in that general sense which includes the instrumental, — like its modern representative μέ; cp. ἑ 13 σκοπεῖ μετὰ τῆς ἰδ’. ἀσθενείας, § 2 I προσβ. μετὰ τῶν αἰσθήσεων, ἑ 28 μεθ’ οὗ λόγος. So here it will mean ‘with their contrary (i. e. corrective) force.' 10. ἄτεχνον ὕφ’.] a kind of oxymoron. Gr. uses ὑφαίνειν in a wide way, without any notion of ‘weaving'; e.g. § 24 συνυφαίνων τὴν ᾠδήν. 11. ἐπαινετά] agrees with ταῦτα, the question τί τὸ μέγα κτλ. being parenthetical. τῆς σχές. depends on ἐπαιν., ’ to be praised for, in reference to, their correlation to each other. ’ 14. οὐδέ γὰρ ὁ λόγος κτλ.] ‘reason knows of nothing for it (the earth) to rest upon.'
footnote 27. 15 απαντας] πάντας bdef || om η e 2. τ. κατ’ ὁ. ἐναλλ. μεθ’.] Mountain passes into plain by degrees. 4. εἰς οἰκ. νενεμ] ‘occupied for habitations? 5. ὅσην] rel. to antec. ἡ δὲ ἀοἰκ., ‘where where the too great height of the mountains cuts it off; the mountains are regarded as appropriating the space (mid.). 6. καἰ ἄλλη κτλ.] ‘and one part ἲς severed from another and comes to a different bound? such as the Atlantic or the Indian Ocean. Cp. Acts xxvi 27. 27.The sea, the rivers. 10. ἵσταται λελ.] ‘it ties at ease? opp. to being gathered up in stormy waves. It almost looks as if by μέγεθος Gr. meant the sea in storm (?‘height’). 15. ποταμοὺς ἄπ’] ’Eccl. i 7 but Gr. prob. draws the thought from Aristotle. 16. περιουσίαν] Cp. ἑ 25. If that be not the reason, Gr. knows no other ἢ οὐκ οἶδ.). Cp. § 30. ib. ὄριον] Jer. v 22. 19. τὰτηλ.] in app. to τὴν θάλ., ταῖς ἑ. ἐπ’. to κυάθω. The proverb has been embodied in a pretty legend about St Austin. 20. παρὰ τῆς γρ.] ’’from Scripture,’ ’by borrowing the words of Scr.’ Job xxvi 10. Γυρῷ, ‘to round.’

By ’the land ’’ Gr. means the land animal which nevertheless finds a home on the sea. At the same time the word ναυτίλος had become so exclusively poetical as applied to men and ships, and so recognised a name for the shell-fish, that the ad-dition of χ. was necessary to prevent a moment's mistake. Ἄγει sc. ἢ θάλασσα. 4. deduct] Cp. ἑ 26. Χρείαις κ. ἐπ’. almost ’demand and supply.’ 8. ποταμοῖς] ἴθι the rivers, ’ not ‘with,’ in spite of Hab. iii 9. 10. ἐπεξιούσης] ‘break out.’ 11. ἢ τῶν ὑδ. ‘how are the waters fed?’ The metaphor more ’luxuriant’ in Greek than in English, and Gr. proceeds, with an apology, to develope it. Some of them, he says, are ’watered from above,’ i.e. are fed by others (and this is the climax of the ’luxuriance’) ’drink with their roots? i.e. are fed by springs from under-ground. These last Gr. had learned from Arist. to be connected with the sea. 28. The air, and all the pheno-mena of meteorology. 16. καθ’ ὁδόν] ’in due order,’ ’methodically’; Plat. Rep. 435 Α.

Meteor, i 4. 9. μανοτάτων] μανός (the quan-tity of the α is variable) = ’rare,’ as opp. to ’dense.’ The interjection of τῶν μ. is, of course, Gr.'s form counter argument. The clouds are too ’rare’ to produce such effects. 17. λόγον ἔγμως κτλ.] ’know that it is reason to know the things above reason? Something like St Austin’s Credo ut intellegam. 18. ἔπη. ἢ περίγ.] ’on the earth or concerned with the earth, ignorant even of your ignorance? Cp. Plat. Leg. ix 863 c. 29.

Gr. will not pronounce upon the ques-tion whether the heavenly φύσις, i.e. the angels, are incorporeal or not (cp. ἑ 8); but, even if they are, we cannot conceive of them except through corporeal images (cp. §§ 12, 13), such as are suggested by the language of Scripture. 4. προσαγ. ἢ γιν.] ‘is called, or is made.’ 5. ποιεῖν γ. λέγεται] Ps. ciii (civ) 4, Heb. i 7. 6. εἰ μὴ ποιεῖν] ’unless by "making’’ is meant keeping them to the law of their original creation.’ To ’make’ the angels winds suggests a change in their mode of existence; but Gr. thinks that it may denote what is contained in the original act of creation, and not something sub-sequent. 8. ἀκούει] audit, ’it is called.’ 9. τῆς π. οὐσίας] sc. θεοῦ; cp. § 7. 11. ἰλιγγιῶμεν] Cp. § 21. 13. λαμπρότητας, ἀναβάσεις] It seems as if these, like the foregoing, were recognised titles for spiritual beings; but they do not appear to be used by any other of the Fathers. Ἀνάβασις is a strange designation for a personal being, and, if it not for the ν. δὺν. which follows, it might have been thought that Gr. had turned from the angelic beings to their actions, and that referred (as perh. it does in any case) to Jacob’s dream. 14. νόας] ace. pi. of νοῦς.
