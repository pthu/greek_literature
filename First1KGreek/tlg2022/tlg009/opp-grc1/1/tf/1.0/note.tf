6304	footnote 1. Ι ἐπικόπτων] ἐπισκώπτων b ΙΙ ’τον λόγον] τῶν λόγων b II 3 ἐν τοῖς] om ἐν c ΙΙ 7 πνεύματι θαρρήσαντες cde || 8 ἤμων] ἥμιν b ΙΙ 10 προσενεγκωμεν f 1. We have stated our objections to the hasty theology of the Euuomians; but it is a harder task to set forth our own. I will endeavour to do so with the aid of the Holy Spirit, — as indeed I have done before, but it is more necessary now than ever, — as briefly ἃς I can. 1. ἐπικόπτων] ’by way of check-’ Αὐτῶν, the Eunomians. 2. τὸ...ἐπισφαλές] ’the danger.’ 4. τὸ μὲν ἐπισφαλές] κτλ.] taken from Demosth. Olynth. i 7. 6. ἀντεισάγειν] not merely ‘to state in opposition,’ but to ‘instate,’ to ‘substitute.’ 8. προσκυνουμένῳ] This does not compel us to suppose that Gr. used or was acquainted with the last part of our present ‘ Nicene ’ Creed. See the quotations in Hort Two Diss, p. 88. 11. τοῦτο γὰρ μόνον] The verb omitted would prob. have to be expressed by perf. and pres. together; ’have been and are.’ Gr. refers to former outspoken sermons of his such as Orat. XX. For νέαν. cp. i 2.
footnote 2 εὐδοκιμεῖσθαι b || 6 om ὡς f || 7 γενηται] γένωνται b ‘Reg. Cypr.’ || 9 διαχυθῇ bd ’Reg. Cypr.’ || IO νοούμενα] λεγόμενα ’Reg. Cypr.’ 1. τῆ ὑποστολῇ] Heb. x 38, 39 (Hab. ii 4). The word, as the context here shews, implies a disingenuous reticence; cp. Gal. ii 12, 13. 2. διττοῦ δὲ ὄντος] The Bene-dictine editors compare Athenagoras de Resurr. 1. 7. αὐτοί] the Eunomians. Gr. incidentally shews how systematically they went to work. 10. σωλῆνισφιγγ.] ’compressed in α pipe.’ 11. χεόμ. κ. λυόμ.] Cp. ii 13. 2. Atheism, Polytheism, Monotheism, are the three ancient opinions about God. The second ends in the same anarchy as the first, and we leave it to the Gentiles. Our Monotheism, however, is one where Three Persons are joined in equality of nature and in identity of will, — two of the three being derived from the first by what Scripture describes as generation and emission respectively. 12. αἱ ἀνωτάτω δόξαι] ’the most ancient opinions.’ 13. παισὶν Ἑλλήνων] a phrase formed on the fashion of υἱοὶ Ἰσραήλ; but the word παῖδες seems to be chosen with a view to the verb ἐπαίχθησαν. ‘With the first two the children of Greece amused themselves.’ 14. τό τε γάρ] The γάρ gives the reason why Gr. leaves those theories to the children of Greece (imperative). 17. ἀταξία γὰρ μ. λ.] ’Disorder is the prelude to ’For μελέτη (lit. ’practice,’ ’rehearsal’) cp. i 7.
footnote 2. 6 γενητης] γεννήτης def || τῆ γε οὐσία] τῆ ἐξουσία ac (sed τῆ γε οὐσία in marg.) g: τῆ γε οὐσία e in rasura 1. μ. δέ, οὐχ ἢν ἐν] ‘Not a souereignty contained in a single person.’ 2. ἐστι γάρ] Such a sovereignty, of a single person, does not necessarily exclude the thought of discord and confusion. It is possible to conceive of a single entity being divided against itself, and so becoming many. The divine unity, which we believe, is the result of ‘equality of nature, unanimity of judgment, and identity of action’ ‘of will.’ 5. πρὸς τὸ ἐν κτλ.] This complete harmony of mind and will in the Godhead is itself based upon the concurrence of the other Blessed Persons with that One of Their number from whom They are derived, viz. the Father. Gr. does not as yet name the Father, nor indeed any of the Persons, because he is speaking in the abstract of the divine unity and its conditions, and so says τὸ ἐν and not rbv ἔνα. Α comparison of v 14 shews that τῶν ἐξ αὐτοῦ depends on σύννευσις, not on τὸ ἐν. The ‘antecedent’ of ἐξ αὐτοῦ (neut.) is τὸ ἐν. ib. ὅπερ] refers to the whole fourfold description. It is perhaps not impossible that such an unity should exist among creaturely beings, but our experience suggests no instance of it, — only imperfect images of it. The clause is of course parenthetical. 6. ὥστε] again refers to the whole description. It will be seen that οὐσία to Gr. means more than φύσις. There is a moral element in it, and not only a metaphysical; ὁμοτιμία φύσεως is one of the things which secure οὖσ’. μὴ τ. The reading τῆ ἐξουσίᾳ gives no satisfactory sense. 7. μονὰς ἀπ’ ἀρχῆς] The language comes perilously near the Sabellian conception of πλατυσμός (see Dorner Person of Christ div. I, vol. 2, p. 156); but of course Gr.'s tenses κινηθεῖσα, ἔστη) are not to be understood in a temporal sense. There was no time before the κίνησις of which he speaks. For μάρι see ii 9. 9. γενν. κ. προβ.] the γεννήτωρ, of course, of the Son; προβολεύς, of the Spirit. 12. ἀφελών κτλ.] Gr. knows no other way of expressing the relation of the Son and Spirit to the Father, such as might get rid of material suggestions.
footnote 1 θαρρήσωμεν ab II 3 ὑπερερρύη] ὑπερρύη dfg || 4 πέρι] + τῆς f || IO om καὶ f 3. 13 πνεῦμα] + τὸ ἄγιον c ’Colb. I’ || 17 ει] + μὴ ’Coisl. 3’ 3. οἷον κρατήρ τις] The simile is used by Plato Tim. 41 D; but, as Jahn points out in his annotations Elias, in a different connexion. Gr. prob. refers to some Neoplatonic author. 7. ἐπὶ τῶν ἠμ’. ὄρων] keeping to consecrated by Christian usage; cp. i 5. 9. ὥς πού φησιν] John xv 26. 3. The acts thus described are above and before time, although it is impossible to divest ourselves of ternporal notions in attenmpting to illustrate them. The Second and Third Persons are not posterior to the First point of time, though Their being springs out of His. 11. ταῦτα] sc. τὸ γεννητόν and τὸ ἐκπορευόμενον. This is shewn by ὅτε ὁ πατήρ in the next line, ib. ὑπὲρ τὸ πότε] above and be yond a ’when.’ 13. οὐκ ἢν ὅτε οὐκ ἢν] He replies with the phrase so well known at the beginning of the Arian controlanguage versy. ib. τοῦτο] sc. what is implied in οὐκ ἢν ὁτε οὐκ ἢν, eternal. 19. ἔμφασιν] ’an image.’ In order to convey any notion of what is above time, it is impossible to avoid the employment of temporal imagery. Ἔμφασις is, however, used in rhetoric for an innuendo, a sugin gestion of something beyond what the words express; and this may be Gr.'s meaning here.
footnote 2 συμπαρεκτεινόμενον c ‘Reg. Cypr.’ || 3 λαμβάνομεν b II 6 ἐκεῖνον def τὸ ’δε ἀίδιον def || 9 ὢν] + ἐστιν bdf 2. πλὴν εἰ κτλ.) The only way, Gr. says, is to adopt the standard of Eternity. Eternity does indeed suggest a kind of temporal duration; that cannot be helped; but we use it to denote ’an interval or ’ commensurate with things of a supra-temporal order, not measured by any measurement known to time. It seems best to connect the πλὴν with εἰ καἰ μὴ δυνάμεθα, and to treat the intervening sentence (in accordance with Gr.s manner) as parenthetical. 5. ἐκεῖθεν] sc. ἐκ τοῦ πατρός. 9. τοῦ φωτὸς ἤλως] The simile is, of course, unscientific; but it serves its purpose. 10. ἄναρχά πὼς τῷ χρ.] In a sense, so far as time is concerned, that which is Begotten and that which Proceeds are without a beginning, as no date can be assigned, prior to which They had not begun. ib. μορμολύττῃ] ‘to scare’ with μορμώ, or bugbear. 4. If difficulty is felt about the ‘generation’ of the Son by the Father, the difficulty is not got rid rid by making the Son a ‘creature’ instead. It only arises from a carnal notion of what is meant by generation, as if there could be no higher hind of generation. 15. πῶς θεός] which the Eunomians acknowledged, though with an interpretation of their own. 16. κἀνταῦθα] i.e. ἐν τῷ κτίζειν. Α work of creation (lit. ‘founding’) as known to man involves time in which to work it out, desire for the accomplishment, the formation of a mental ideal, thought as to the mode of execution, etc. Gr.'s objeel is to shew that the thought of creation on ’s part involves as many difficulties as that of generation.
footnote 4. 1 ἔφεσις χρόνος ac li 4 ἐννοεῖν] ἐπινοεῖν b ‘Reg. ’ 5 κυησεως] κινήσεως d ΙΙ 8 τούτων] + δὴ ’Or. I’ || 9 ἐναίρειν ‘Reg. Cypr.’ || καινῆς] κενῆς be ’Reg. Cypr.’: + σου beg 15 του] rob: του f in rasura || 17 πατρὶ] πατὴρ b ’Reg. a1’ 4. συνδυασμούς] ‘copulation.’ 5. ἀμβλώσεως] ‘miscarriage.’ 6. οὕτω] by such ways as συνδυασμός and so on. 9. ἢ καί] ‘or else, ’ if the generation of the Son does not fit in with your select example, ‘get rid of Him altogether as a result of your novel scheme.’ 12. ἢ πνεῦμ’. γέννησις] i.e. His generation ace. to His divine nature. Ἐξαλλάττειν is freq. used intrans. 5. The Father never ωας anything else but Father. While we human beings are sons, as well as fathers, He is absolutely Father, and that alone. If we say that He ’has begotten’ a Son, we do mean to imply a moment or date. Scripture often uses tenses in a way which differs from that of ordinary life. 15. τίς οὖν] It is the ’s question: ‘What father is there who never began to be a father ?’ 17. οὔκουν π. ὕστ.] ‘He did become Father at some subsequent point, because (ace. to the foregoing argument) He never began to be.’ 18. κυρίως] ‘properly, because He is not at the same time Son.’ on the other hand, Gr. goes on to say, are not ‘properly ’ fathers, because we are ἄμφω, sons as much as fathers. The variety of our relationships makes it impossible to consider any one of them an exhaustive description of a human being; but fatherhood expresses all that the person of God the Father is.
footnote 5 ἐγέννησεν αὐτὸ φησιν f || 12 τῆς] + θείας b 1. ἐξ ἀμφοῖν] not the same ἄμφω as above, but here as if = ἐκ δυοῖν. Gr. is thinking chiefly how our sonship differs from that of the Eternal Son, and leaves the difference of the fatherhood. Each of us has two parents, not one, so that we are in a way divided between them. 2. κατ’ δλ. ἄνθρ.] another difference; we only gradually attain the position of human beings by a long fashioning in the womb, and some hardly attain it at all. In the last clause no doubt Gr. means idiots and persons otherwise deficient. The wishes of human parents for their offspring are often far from being realised οἶοι μὴ τεθ.). 3. ἀφιέντες] The children in many cases go their way, and the parents theirs, and nothing is left of the sacred relationship except the name. 5. ἐγέννησε] We have been using expressions like ‘begat’ and ‘is begotten,’ which necessarily besides the notion of begetting, the tense-notion of a moment when. To evade the difficulty, Gr. proposes to use a formula which puts the ‘moment’ back before the beginning of time, and to say that the Son ‘was’ already ‘begotten from the beginning.’ 9. γραφὴν ἀποίσεις καθ’ ἤμ’.] a legal term, which has only an accidental relation to the use of γραφὴ immediately after in the sense of ’Scripture.’ It means ‘to file an accusation? ib. παραχαραττόντων] ‘putting a false mark ’ i.e. ‘falsifying’; chiefly used of coin that has been tampered with. 11. ἐνηλλαγμ. τ. χρδν.] Much of our language which denotes time is used in an inverse manner to the time intended. 14. ἴνα τί ἐφρ.] Psalm ii 1.
footnote 3 εἴη] ην f 6 φασι] φησι df || 7 οιονται] οιον τε ’duo Colb.’ || 11 καινὴν] κενὴν ’Reg. Cypr.’ 1. ἐν ποταμῶ Psalm lxv (lxvi) 6. 4. τετήρηνται] ‘have been observed.’ 6. ’Did the Father beget the Son,’ asks the opponent, ‘by an act of will, or not? If not, He was tinder constraint, which is impossible; if so, then the Son owes His being not to the Father only, but also to the Father's will, zvhich thus becomes α kind of motherhood.’ This dilemma is met by a similar one with regard to the ’s οὗκ birth, and by another with regard to creation. Gr. then shews that ἃς a word is not the result of speaking, considered as α separate ajtd sub-stantive thing, but springs direct from the speaker, so the thing willed springs not from will in the abstract, but direct from him who wills. 8. σαθροῖς] Cp. i 3. 11. πῶς οὖν ἐκ τοῦ π.] It certainly seems a strangely captious argument. If it was ever seriously urged by the Eunomians, we must suppose that θέλων is not merely = ἑκών, but ’by willing’; i.e. it was the act of will which produced the Son. Then, as other faculties of the divine being are represented to us as hypostatic — notably the Λόγος — we are driven to suppose that this primary faculty, antecedent and necessary to the production of the Son, is hypostatic also. If that is the case, He does not owe His being solely to the Father, but partly also to the ’s Will, which is thus constituted a kind of mother in the Godhead. But Gr.'s subsequent words ἂν τοῦτο λέγωσιν suggest the doubt whether he did not himself invent this part of the argument for the Eunomians. 13. αὐτῶν] depends upon χαρίεν (av εἴη) by an idiom well known in colloquial English as well as in Greek; ‘it it will be delightful of them.’ 14. οὐ γὰρ πάθος ἢ β.] This is true; nevertheless it is difficult for the human mind to imagine an act of will which is not caused by something which would come under the description of a πάθος.
footnote 2 αν] ἔαν b || 3 εθελης] θέλῃς def ΙΙ 7 θεληματος] θελήσεως def || 10 υπεστησε] + θεὸς bcd: + ο θεὸς ef || 14 θελησει] θέλησις b || om γὰρ b || 15 ἐστιν οἴμαι θέλων bdf 1. τὸ ἴσχ’. αὐτ’. ö τι λ] ‘what they consider their strong point? Δεύτερον δὲ corresponds to ἐν μέν. Before, however, entering upon this δεύτερον, which he does at ἀλλ’ ἐπὶ τ. θ., Gr. thinks it best πρότερον) to grapple with his adversaries at closer quarters. This he does in the question σὺ δὲ αὐτός κτλ., which brings the argument home to them personally ἐγγυτέρω). 5. οὐ γὰρ δὴ τὴν φύσιν ἐρεῖς] ‘You will not say that he was compelled by nature. Nature admits equally of self-restraint.’ 10. ὑπέστησε] ‘gave them existence,’ ence? i.e. by creation. 12. ἐσηρηται τοῦ θ.κ. τὰ κτ] As, ace. to their supposed argument, the Son is deprived of the Father by the interposition of the Will from which He sprang, so is creation deprived of its Creator. His Will runs like a wall between it and Him. The Eunomian is the first to suffer the loss, because he invented it; that is poetical justice. 15. ἕτερον οἷμαι] Gr.'s argument is not very clear; because the Eunomians also had distinguished very sharply between the will and the person who wills, — so sharply that they said that the Son could not be the Son of one who willed to beget Him, but only of that will itself. But in so arguing they set up a new, though fictitious, identity. They converted the will itself into a personal agency. This is what Gr. combats. Will is one thing, and the person who wills is another. You might as well say that the thing begotten is the son of beget-ting, or trace the thing spoken to speaking instead of the speaker, as thus erect will into a substantive and independent force.
footnote 1 μεθύωμεν b ΙΙ 5 γεννῶντος cdefg || 7 δεξ̣ͅομεθα deg ‘Or. 1’ 1. τὰ μέν] i.e. the series θέλων, γεννῶν, λέγων; τὰ δέ, i.e. the series θέλησις, γέννησις, λόγος. 3. οὐδὲ γὰρ ἕπεται πάντως] Gr. is using ἕπεται in its logical sense. He does not mean that in the order of facts the act of will sometimes fails of its effect; he means that it does not ‘follow’ that, because a thing has been willed, that thing is the result of will. It is the result of the personal force lying behind the will. 5. τὰ τοῦ θεοῦ δέ] All this holds true even in the experience of our limited personalities; much more may we suppose it to be so in regard to the divine nature. With God, so far as we know ἴσως), will and action are identical, and there is no medium whatever. 7. καὶ τοῦτο] i.e. the proposition that γέννησις = ἡ τοῦ γ. θ. Gr. evidently inclines rather to the view that ‘the generation ὁ the Son of God is even above and beyond will.’ 7. Gr. retaliates by asking how God comes to be God. If by His will, when did He first will it? is one portion of His being the result of the will of another portion? is He not in this case as much a child of will as the Son? If He is God without willing to be so, then He is under compulsion. ‘How then, is the Son begotten?’ asks the Eunomian. ‘How is He created?’ οἱ. replies. Men do create in the way which it is to assume was ’s way. 9. βούλει τι κτλ.] ’Do you wish me to make sport awhile with the Father also? ’ Hitherto the ‘sport’ has been with the Son. Gr. intentionally uses a shocking expression. 11. καὶ ὅπως ἀποφ.] ’and in order that you may escape: The main verb is the imperative implied in the question πότε. . . ἠργμένος μόνος — ‘tell me when.’ 12. πρὶν εἶναι] sc θεός; ‘not befpre He was so; for He tvas never anything before.’ 13. τὸ μὲν αὐτοῦ] ‘or did one part of Him will it, while the other part was the result of that will?
footnote 7. 1 ουν] + φησι bedf ΙΙ 6 ειποις] + ὅτι b 8. 13 οιει] οιη e || τα ce race 2. εἰς τὸ εἶναι] again ’ to be so,’ i.e. θεός. 3. καἰ ταῦτα κτλ.] ‘and compelled to that very thing, namely to be God.’ 4. πῶς οὖν] Gr. returns rapidly to the original question, and again parries it by the counter question as to the creation of the Son. The difficulty of imagining the creation is as great as that of imagining the generation. 7. ἔργου δύν. ἔσχειν] ‘how came it to have that effective force?" 9. οὕτως] sc βούλεται καἰ λόγει. 8. You do not understand your own generation, or the law of your own development; how can you expeel to understand that of God? That, however, ἲς no proof that God does not beget. If nothing is to be true but what you understand, must reduce the list of existences, beginning with that of God Himself The mode of the divine generation is evidently beyond us. 14. λόγους συμπ.] ‘the formulae,’ or ‘laws.’ 16. τροφῆς ἐξομ.] ‘assimilation of food.’ 17. μνήμην, ἀνάμν.] Cp. ii 22. ib. τίνα μέν] ‘what things belong to the united compound of soul and body.’ 19. τὰ μεμερ.] We might have expected μεμερισμένων, ‘belong to soul and body apart’; but it ‘which are the things distributable’ to soul and body respectively.
footnote 2 φιλοσοφήσεις af: -σοις ‘Or.

For ῥεύσεις cp. v 31; for διαιρ. and τομάς cp. i 6. 15. δυσχεραίνων] ‘with loathing.’ 20. ἀμβλυωπίαν] ’the dulness of’ your ’blinded sight.’ 9. A fresh puzzle is proposed by the Eunomian. Does the Son exist prior to generation, or not? The answer ἲς that there is no such as a time prior to that generation. It is from all eternity. There is no more need to ask whether the Son is ἐξ ὄντων or ἐξ οὐκ ὄντων than there is to ask the same question concerning the Father. We are not compelled to believe that either one or the other of two alternates is true. Take instances. Is time in time or outside of time? A man says, ‘I am lying’: is he speaking the truth or not? Were yon present at your own conception or not? Both alternatives may be false. The question is absurd.
footnote 9. 1 τῶν] ω τῶν e || 6 ἀγένητον] ἀγέννητον def ΙΙ ἀναπλάττουσιν e || 7 τὼ εἶναι τὸ] τὸ εἶναι τὼ ‘Reg.’ a’ 9 η τὸ μὴ] om τὸ cd 1. ὄντα] Α fresh difficulty: was the Son already in existence when He was begotten, or not? Gr. admits that the question might have some meaning in regard to human generation. In one sense we already existed τὸ μέν τι); in another, we then began to be (λγλόναμεν practically=ἐγενήθημεν). 3. ὁ Λευί] Heb. vii 10. 4. τὸ ἡμέτερον] = ἡμεῖς. 6. κἄν τινες ἂγ. ἀναπλ.] The reference is to ’s Timaeus. ib. σύνδρομον τῷ εἰ. τὸ γ.] ’In this ’ of the Eternal Son, ‘generation is coincident with existence, and is from all eternity.’ 7. ποῦ θήσεις] Where will you find a place, a date, for your question to apply to? ‘Already in existence when He was begotten ’ implies a time before the begetting; but there was no such time. He was begotten from the beginning. What was there before ’the begin-ning, ’ that we may say whether the Son then existed or not? In either case, whether we affirm or deny His existence, it is clear that that subsequent moment at which we suppose Him to have been begotten cannot really have been the beginning. 10. εἰ μή σοι κ. ὁ π.] If you still press your question, we will once more ask you about the Father, whether His existence is derived from elements that were beforehand or from elements that were not. Perhaps then you will make out that both propositions are true, and that He has two modes or stages of existence, one before and the other after the absorption of those elements. Or you will choose the latter alternative, and say of Him, as you say of the Son, that He comes into being from nothingness. If you are ready to admit this of the Father (such is the force of the εἰ μή), there is some consistency in what you affirm of the Son.
footnote 3 ἐκ ψάμμων] εξ ἄμμων a || οἰκοδομίας ac || 12 om η ’duo Reg.’ 1. ö μὲν πρ., δ δὲ ὤν] For this use of δ (here accus.) cp. Matt. xiii 8. 4. μ. αὔραις ἵστανται] ‘cannot even stand a puff of wind’; a natural use of ἴστ’. but difficult to parallel. ib. τούτων] of the two alternatives, ὄντα ἢ οὐκ ὄντα γεγέννηκεν.  5. τὸ ἄπορον τὴν ἀπ’.] Α chiasm: ἀπάντ. corresponds to ἐρώτ., as τὸ ἄπορον to τὸ ἄτοπον. It is not that the encounter presents a difficulty, but the question presents an ab-surdity. 10. τί παρὰ τοῦτον ὄντι] ’what is it besides the time which is in it? and how does it contain that ?’ 12. τοῦ δέ, Νῦν ἐγὼ ψ.] Α well-known puzzle. ’"I am now telling a lie." One thing or the other; is the statement true or false? We will not admit that it is both. you answer, it is impossible to adopt the one alternative to the exclusion of the other, for if he is lying, he speaks the truth, and if he speaks the truth, he lying.’ 15. τί οὖν θαυμαστόν] As, in the case of the ψευδόμενος, contradictories are reconciled, so we need not be surprised if, in the proposed dilemma of ὄντα ἢ οὐκ ὄντα, both alternatives are false. 17. ἠλίθιον] ‘silly.’

The contrast of begotten and unbegottens is only like that of wise and uniwise, which can be predicated of different individuals without involvomg α difference of nature or essence. To erect Unbegottenness into Constituting the very essence of God brings you into difficulties with other attributes, like Immortal, Unchangesable, able, which have ἃς good a right to be considered ἃς constituting that essence. 7. οὐ ταὐτόν] ‘not the same thing’; i.e. a difference of nature itself is involved. 14. πῶς οὐ ταὐτόν] llOt ’ III what sense do you ’ for Gr. is not prepared to admit that it is true in any sense ; but simply challenging the statement altogether: ’ how can you say so? if you had said thai created and uncreated are not tin same, I should agree with you, but the transmission of the ’s nature is of the very essence of generation.’

If τὸ ἀγέννητον constitutes the divine nature, so that it and τὸ θεῖον are convertible terms, a similar case can be made out for these other predicates. Then, since the divine nature is absolutely identified with τὸ ἀγέννητον, and yet at the same time with τὸ ἀθάνατον, we are driven to suppose that these are separate natures, or essences, or that they compose the divine nature by their aggregation. 11. Assume for the sake of argument that to be unbegotten belongs to God alone, though the assertion would by some be denied. It does not follow that unbegottenness is a necessary part of the divine essence. Adam alone was directly fashioned by God; yet Seth is as truly man as Adam. The divine essence is a positive, not α negative thing. If you ask me what it is, I can answer that I hope we may know some day, but not here. Meanwhile, whatever glory there is in the underived existence belongs to the Son who is begotten of the Underived. 13. κοινὰ γάρ] Angels e.g. are ἀθάνατοι; doves and lambs are called ἄκακα. 15. οἱ καὶ τὴν ὔ.] The Platonists. Gr. does not adopt their opinion. He only uses it to embarrass the Eunomian. He might have cited in like manner the ’darkness,’ which the Manichees made to be coeternal with light ; but he disdains to do so.

If ‘unbegotten’ and ‘God’ were equivalent terms, then we should be able to put the one for the other, and say not only ’ the God of Israel’ but ‘the Unbegotten of Israel? On this theory, the nature of the begotten Son is not only different from that of the unbegotten Father, but is its exact opposite; and indeed it might be argued that since the positive is prior to the negative, the begotten Son is prior to the unbegotten Father. 7. ἔσται τοῦτο] sc. ἀγέννητον Quite true, Gr. replies, on the assumption that unbegottenness is the essence of God; the Son in that case will be begotten-unbegotten! 9. περὶ οὐσίαν] The prep, is emphatic.

footnote 8 εἰσαχθῆναι] ἀντεισαχθῆναι b 1. τινῶν ὁ θεός] ’God,’ acc. to Gr., is a relative term; a ’ God ’ must be ’God of’ some one. If then unbegottenness is the very essence of God, and ‘unbegotten’ and ‘God’ are convertible terms, then we must be able to say with equal correctness, ’ the God of all ’ and ‘the unbegotten of all’; or conversely, as the unbegotten is ’no one's unbegotten,’ so God must be ‘no one's God.‘ The argument does not seem a very valuable one, because, to begin with, it must be questioned whether ‘God’ is really a term of relationship. If it be so, then apart from creation God would not be God. But the main purpose of the argument is sound, inasmuch as it shews the absurdity of identifying absolutely the positive existence of God with a merely negative description. On Gr. ’s interprettation of the word θεός, see iv 18. 3. ὁμοίως ἐκφέρεται] True synonyms are used interchangeably (lit. ’are produced, employed, in a similar manner’); cp. προφέρεται in § 5. 8. ἀνάγκη] If ἀγέννητον is the very nature of God, and yet God begets a Son (which the Eunomians in a sense allow), it follows that the nature of the Son is not only different from that of the Father, but is diametrically opposite to it. This is not allowed by any one οὐ δέδοται). 9. αἱ ἔξεις τῶν ’στ’. πρότεραι] You cannot take away a thing which is not there to begin with. But ἀγέννητον implies a taking away of γέννεννητάν. Therefore γέννητον is prior to ἀγέννητον, — the Son to the Father, — and when the Father comes, and His ἀγέννητον is alone recongised as divine, He does away with the Son who occupied the ground before Him. Of course this argument is one of mere mockery ἐρεσχελία, i 3). 13. ’If the begetting of the Son is not a thing finished ἀν’ ’done with, it is as yet incomplete, and will one day be completed: if it is finished, it must have begun.’ That does not follow. ἱν soul had a beginning, but will never have an end. No; our belief is, that whatever possesses the essential notes of a class of beings — say of α horse or an ox — is rightly called by that name, whatever distinctive properties it may have which mark it off from others of the class. So it ἲς with God; the nature is one, although there are differences of designation, corresponding to differences hi fact, between the Persons who share that natitre.

The meaning is not the same as in ὁ ἡμέτερος λ. just before, nor has it any relation to λέγεσθαι directly after. ib. ὃ μὲν ἂν μετέχῃ τ. λ.] ‘what. ever shares that characteristic principle, is rightly called by that name.’ Tοῦτο, however, is grammatically the subject of λῆ., not the predicate. 17. οὕτω δέ] The ‘apodotic’ force of δέ is well known. It recurs again in the next section.
footnote 4 ἥμιν ἐστιν f 14. 3 προσοίσουσιν bedef 1. κἂν ἐπινοίαις τισι] The distinctive ’notions’ which Gr. has in view are, of course, those of giving and of receiving life, of ‘proceeding ’ and its correlative. They are not, however, to be considered as merely subjective distinctions drawn by us, any more than the distinctions which we draw between one man and another. Td ὀνόματα, sc. πατήρ, υἱός, πνεῦμα. 2. ὃ μὲν ἂν κ. λέγηται] sc. θεός.

The ὀνομάζεσθαι = λέγεσθαι, and has nothing to do with the ὀνόματα above. 4. οἱ δέ] While names are not of much importance, so long as we get the facts right, they, the Eunomians, when pressed, will use the name of θεός to describe the Son, but explain it to have no foundation in fact. 7. ταῖς μαρτυρίαις] ’’testimonies of Scripture.’ Cp v 2 29. ib. ὁμώνυμον] ‘in an equivocal sense.’ Ὁμώνυμα are in logic which bear the same name but in different senses. 14. ’ The word God,’ they ’is an aequivocum; it is used to denote two things which are essehtially different, as dig, for example, denotes both α beast and α ’ Ah, but in the one case there is no difference in dignity between the two things which bear the same name; in the other, if your theory were true, two beings would bear the same name which cotild not be even distantly compared. 12. ὁμ. ταῦτα εἶναι] The neut. used, as in the preceding section, to avoid the irreverence of a direct reference to the Divine Persons. 13. τὸν κύνα] the name of a fish, as well as of the beast.

The common name is borne by creatures which, though different from each other, are equals. 11. ἐνταῦθα δέ] ’ But when come to the case in point, you attach to God an awful solemnity, and say that He is too high to be described as having any essence or nature, — athing which belongs to none but God and constitutes as it were the nature of the Godhead; and you give this to the Father, but take it away from the Son, and make a subject of Him.’ 17. περικόπτεις] ‘mutitate.’ ib. τῆς τὸ 1. ἐχ’. ὁμων.] such as that of the different ’dogs.’ 19. ὁ γραπτός σ. κ. ὁ ζῶν ἆ] The real man and the picture of a man (either of which is spoken of as ’a man’) illustrate more nearly such a Godhead as the Eunomians speak of than the two kinds of ’dogs.’ The picture is not further from being a real man than the Son is from being really God, if the Eunomian account is correct; and at the same time it bears externally a greater resemblance to its original.
footnote 3 τῶν φύσεων] τῆς φύσεως ’nonnul.’ || 6 ἰσότιμον] + μὴ bedef 15. 11 om ’δε b ’nonnul.’ 1. ἢ δός] Otherwise, — if the chasm between the two Persons bearing the name of God is not, on your theory, as vast as I have indicated, suppose you admit that the equivocal name is in this instance applied to two natures of equal splendour. You shall call them different natures, if you like; but admit that they are equal. What is the result? You are no longer satisfied with your illustration of the dogs. You invented it to justify an insinuation of inequality. The κατὰ in κατὰ τῆς ἀνισ. appears to be used as in the phrase τοξεύειν κατὰ σκοποῦ, of the point aimed at. 5. εἰ τὸ ἴσ’. ἔχοιεν] It requires great ingenuity to extract any meaning from the sentence, in relation to the context, if the reading μὴ ἔχ. is adopted. The μὴ was evidently introduced by copyists who thought that Gr. was making a statement of his own belief, which was that the name θεός is applied in precisely the same sense to Father and Son. But this ignores Gr.'s argument, — and, it may he added, the meaning of ὁμωνυμία. Gr.'s immediate purpose is to shew that the Eunomian illustration is, from their own point of view, ill-chosen. To be of any service to them, their instance of ’equivocation’ should have been one where the same name is applied to two objects of very different value. 15.‘You admit,’ they say, ‘that the Father is greater than the Son, inasmuch ἃς He is the author of the Son's being; but since He ἲς by nature author of the ’s being, it follows that He is by nature greater than the ’ The fallacy of the argument, Gr. annoers, lies in this, —that they attribute to the underlying essence what is predicated of the particular possessor of that essence. It is like arguing that because so and so is a dead man, therefore man is dead. 10. τῷ αἰτίῳ μ.] lby virtue of being the cause of His existence. 11. προσλαβόντες τὴν . . . πρότασιν] ‘taking ὂν their minor premiss. Πρότασις is the tehnical word for a ‘premiss’; the πρός in προσλ. denotes that this is a second (or minor) premiss.
footnote 1. συνάγωσιν] ‘conclude.’ The Eunomian syllogism is this: ’The Father is greater than the Son inasmuch as the Son owes His existence to Him. But the giving of existence to the Son belongs to the Father by nature. Therefore the Father is greater than the Son by nature.’ 3. οὐ γὰρ ἁπλῶς κτλ.] The reply is that not everything which is predicated of a particular thing (e.g. of Socrates) is predicated of the nature which underlies that thing (in the example chosen, human nature). Everyone recognises what the statements are intended to apply to, and how they apply. So, what we say of the Father does not necessarily apply to the Divine Essence which belongs to Him; some things apply to Him as Father, not as God. 4. κατὰ τίνος, καὶ τίνα] The words are interrogative; if Gr. had intended the indef. pron., he must have said δ. ὅτι κ. τ. It seems necessary to understand κατὰ again before τίνα, ’in regard to what ’ — i.e. in regard to nature, or to individuality, or what. To take the example given by Gr. at the end of the section, if I say that Socrates is a dead man, it is plain that I am speaking of Socrates in particular and of no one else, and that I am speaking of Socrates in relation to the bodily life, not about his soul, nor about his influence. 5. τί κωλύει κἀμέ] Two can play at that game, Gr. says. He too can draw that kind of conclusion, and they shall see whether it will hold. He makes a major premiss of that conclusion of theirs, ’The father is by nature greater than the ’ (We need not suppose that Gr. is for the moment speaking of God: the words would suit any father and son.) The minor premiss is, ’But he is not by nature necessarily greater, or necessarily ’ So far there is no absurdity. He need never have had a son; there might have been nothing else to compare him with. (Gr., 1 repeat, is not speaking of God.) The right conclusion would be that the ’s ’natural’ superiority over his son consists solely in his fatherhood, and not in his nature, —in his relationship, and not in that which he is when considered apart by himself. But the false conclusion which Gr. draws, to illustrate the false conclusions of the Eunomians, is this: ’Therefore the greater is not necessarily greater, ’ or ‘The father is not necessarily father.’ It will be observed that Gr. says μεῖζον, not 6 μείζων, which makes it clearer that the proposition is intended to be quite general: Ἁ thing which is greater than another need not be greater, but might be at the same time equal or less; a father need not be his ’s father, but might be his brother or his son.’ The second paralogism ὁ θεὸς οὐ πάντως θεός) helps to shew that this is Gr.'s meaning.

But the sense is the Same either way. In the apodosis, τὸν ἄνθρ. is subject, the predicate being supplied from the previous clause, sc. νεκρὸν εἶναι. The commentators from Elias onwards have totally failed to catch the argument, or even to understand the grammar of the passage. If Gr. had intended to say anything so pointless as Petavius (de Trin. II v 12) makes out, viz. that because ὁ δεῖνα is a dead man, therefore he is a man, he must have said τὸ ἄνθρωπον, not τόν. So far Elias, whom Petavius quotes, knew better. 16. ’ Well? they say, ’the word Father must denote either nature or operation: which is it to be?’ Neither, is the answer; it denotes a relation, and α relation which implies community of nature between the Father and the Son. 10. ἀξιάγαστον] ‘astonishing,’ from ἄγαμαι ’to wonder. ib. οὐσίας, ἢ ἐνεργ. ὄν.] ’is it a name denoting essence, or operation?’ 12. ἑτεροούσιον] A word modelled on the false analogy of ὁμοούσιος.

footnote 7 σου] σοι cdf || 8 ὁμότιμον] + τὼ πατρὶ bdf || 9 om οὐ e || 15 τὼ δια σε] om τὼ c 1. προκοπήν] Luke ii 52. ib. τελείωσιν] Luke xiii 32, Heb. ii 10 etc. 2. ὑπνοῦν] Matt, viii 24. ib. πεινῆν] Matt, xxi 18 etc. ib. κοπιᾷν] John iv 6. 3. δακρύειν] John xi 35. ib. ἀγωνιᾷν] Luke xxii 44. ib. ὑποδύεσθαι] ‘to slip away,’ ‘withdraw’; — a quite classical sense of the word. The ref. is prob. to John x 39. 7. σπερμολογήσαις] ‘pick up,’ like a bird gathering up seed: cp. Acts xvii 18. ib. συντιθέναι] ’to put together vour equivocal God’; with ref. to argument of § 14. 8. παρἐηραπτον] one whose name has been fraudulently put on the list. ib. ὁμότιμον] The words τῷ πατρί are prob. only a gloss, though a correct one. 9. κατὰ μόρος ἐπεξ. ἐξηγ.] ’to go through them in detail and give you a very religious interpretation of each, and to clear away the offence whicli you find in the letter of Scripture.’ 14. παθῶν κ. σῶμ’.] governed by κρείττονι. The Benedictine editors compare with this whole passage Leo Serm. 45 de Quadr. p. 228. See also his letter to Flavian § 4. 15. τῷ συνθέτω The words which follow — τῷ κενωθέντι κτλ.— as well as ἀσύνθετος in ξ 19, shew that Gr. does not mean ‘to the composite nature,’ sc. the human nature composed of body and soul, but ‘to Him who is composite, made up of two ’ Or possibly, as die τῷ is repealed, Gr. may have intended τῷ συνθέτῳ to be the dat. of τὸ σύνθετον, in the sense of ’the composite whole,’ consisting of Godhead and manhood. It would, of course, have been more exact to have said τῆ διὰ σὲ κενώσει, or something of that kind; but it would have been less vivid; and there was no fear of any one supposing that Gr. meant by τῷ κενωθέντι a different person from Him who had the κρείττω φύσιν.
footnote 2 χαμαιπετὲς] χαμερπὲς bef || 4 εναπομενης c 3. συνανιέναι θ.] ’to move upwards — or perh. to grow up — with ’ The words do not necessarily imply that θεότης ἄνεισι, and there is no ref. to the Ascension. 4. ἐναπομένοις] Ἐναπομένειν is ‘to remain on, to remain to the end, in.’ 5. φύσεως λόγος] ’what is the law of His (true, Divine) Nature.’ 6. οἰκονομίας] of accommodation to our circumstances. The word is very freq. used by the fathers in ref. to the Incarnation: see Suicer s.υ., and Sophocles' Lexicon. 19. He was not always, what He became for our sakes; and He ever retained the nature which was originally His. The words which indicate His self-emptying are always balanced by others which indicate His divine glory. 7. καὶ ὑπὲρ σε] ‘even abpve you.’ 8. ὃ μὲν ἢν, διέμεινεν] Cp. Zeno Ver. Serm. ii de Nat. saluo quod erat, meditatur esse quod non erat. St Austin plays upon the same formula in many of his Christmas sermons. See also Leo Serm. xxi de Nat. Dei § 2. 9. ἀναιτίως] It appears like a contradiction of what Gr. has said in ξξ 3. 15. But the sentences which follow shew that Gr. is thinking here of αἰτία in the sense of a final cause. 10. γέγονε] as in the N.T. = ἐγένετο. 12. διὰ μέ σου νοός] Cp. Or. ii 23 θεὸς σαρκὶ διὰ μέσης ψυχῆς ἀνεκράθη, καὶ συνεδέθη τὰ διεστῶτα τῆ πρὸς ἄμφω τοῦ μεσιτεύοντος οἰκειότητι. In Or. xxxviii, after shewing in § 10 how creatures endowed with mind have an affinity with God which other creatm-es have not, Gr. says in § 13 that the Eternal Word was incarnate διὰ μέσης ψυχῆς νοερᾶς μεσιτευούσης θεότητι καὶ σαρκὸς παχύτητι. We cannot imagine an ’incarnation ’ of the Word in an irrational thing.
footnote 19. 2 συνανεκράθη] συνεκράθη b || 4 γεγέννητο c || 9 ἐγίνετο e || 10 ανεκλιθη] ἀνεκλήθη a: ἐτέθη b 1. γενόμενος Ἴ’., ὁ κάτω θεός] ‘was made man, the earthly God.’ Gr. is fond of dwelling upon the intrinsic divinity of man. Cp. Or. xxxviii 7 ἵνα...ὡς οἰκείοις ἤδη προσομιλῇ . . . θεὸς ἑνούμενός τε καὶ γνωριζόμενος. Here, the description of man as ὁ κάτω θεός is prepared for by the words διὰ μέσου νοός. 2. συνανεκράθη θεῶ Cp. iv 2 ἐχρίσθη θεότητι; iv 3 θεῷ πλακῆναι καἰ γεμέσθαι θεὸν ἐκ τῆς μίξεως. The language, if pressed, would imply that Christ was a human person, taken into union with a divine one. This would, of course, be erroneous, and Gr. 's own words immediately before shew that he perfectly understood the Person of our Lord to be divine first, and then by condescension human. Prob. the nom. to συνανεκράθη is strictly supplied from ἄνθρωπος, ὁ κ. θεός, not from ὁ νῦν σοι καταφρονούμενος. The humanity of Christ undoubtedly συνανεκρ. θεῷ. Put the humanity of Christ, impersonal except by virtue of His assumption of it, is not exactly described by the term ἄνθρωπος. The rise of Nestorianism, which was after Gr.'s time, would have suggesed more careful phraseology; and it may be added that a fear of the still later Eutychianism might have made Gr. modify the words συνανεκράθη and τοῦ κρείττονος ἐκνικησαντος. 3. ἵνα γένωμαι] It is perh. somewhat νεανικόν to speak of our becoming Gods ‘to the same extent’ as Christ is man; but doubtless Gr. would explain that he spoke of men in proportion to heir capacity; or perh., in view of what follows, τοσοῦτον means ’as truly.’ He uses the same phrase in Or. xl 45. 4. ἐγεψννητο] ‘He had been begotten before,’ i.e. eternally. 7. ὅλον τοῦτο] both the ἀπάτωρ ἐντ’. and the ἀμήτωρ ἐκ. ib. ἐγνώσθη προφ.] Luke i 41. 9. ἀποσπαργανοῦται τὰ τῆς τ.] Luke xxiv 12, John xx 6 f. 11. ὐπ’ ἀγγ. ἐδοξάσθη] Luke ii 9 f.

Pilati B 8 (Tisch. p. 447). 21. It has been a disagreeable task to examine these objections; believers are not fond of arguing; but it is important to shew that the arguments are not all on the side of heresy. To rely upon logic, however, is the abandonment of faith, the evacuation of the Gospel, and its betrayal. God bring the opponents to a better mind, and grant us a saving hold upon the Trinity. 9. ταῦτα] sc εἰρήκαμεν or εἰρήσθω. 11. εἷς ἀντικείμενος] Satan. ib. τοὺς ἐμπίπτοντας] ‘our assailants.’ 13. ἀήττητοι τ. π. κτλ] κτλ.] ‘invincible in those fine arguments. which make void the Gospel.’ 15. προβαλλώμεθα] ’advance’ as a sword or shield. ib. τὸ το̣ῦ πνεύματος ἀ̣ξ.] ’defeat the credentials of the Spirit by our contentions.’
