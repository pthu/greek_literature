6246	footnote 1. Ι ἐπειδὴ] ἔπει ’δε be || σοι] σου b || 2 τῆ] ἐν τῆ bee ‘Reg. a’ || 3 πάρα] ἄπο b || 6 om μὲν b 1. We have gone rapidly through the Eunomian objections, especially those taken from Scripture, and have laid down a general canon for the interpretation of the texts. We will now take the texts seriatim. 1. στροφάς] Cp. iii 16. πλακὰς is likewise a wrestling metaphor. 2. διεσείσαμεν] Διασείειν is to ‘shake to pieces,’ used of a examination. Plut. de Gen. Socr. 580 D διερωτῶν καὶ διασείων τὸν Εὐθύφρονα. There seems to be no connexion with the preceding metaphors. 4. τοῦ γρ. ἱερόσυλοι] explained by the next clause, τὸν νοῦν..,κλἐπτ. The ‘letter’ is like a temple, which the sacrilegious heretic robs of its ‘meaning.’ 5. σφετερίζονται] ‘take possession of.’ 10. τῷ νέῳ . . . ‘A δάμ] The phrase is not free from danger. An ἱερόσυλος τοῦ γράμματος might make out that the νέος ’Α. was, in ’s view, a different person from the Divine Person implied in τῆ θεότητι. Cp. iii 18, 19. It must be remembered that the Nestorian heresy had not yet been formulated. ib. θεῷ παθητῷ] a daring oxymoron. Gr. would of course deny that the Godhead of Christ was subjected to suffering, though the Divine Person was so subjected, in virtue of the nature which He assumed.
footnote 3 Βραχει] βράχεσι edg ’duo Reg.’ || 4 ημεις] + ’δε ’in nonnul.’ || ταυτας] ταύτα aceg 2. 6 ἐν] ἐν cdeg || 11 τεχνίτου] τεχνικοῦ eg 1. π. κατὰ τῆς ἁμ] a compact expression; ‘suffering against sin,’ i.e. overcoming sin by means of suffering. 2. No. 1. — The Lord created Me ...with a view to His works. We will not shirk the difficulty by making the words a mere personification. It is our Lord who speaks. But the cause which He alleges to have been in vircv at His creation shews that He is speaking of the creation of His manhood, which was created ivith a view to the works of verity and judgment in our salvation. When afterwards He speaks of His Godhead, He uses very different language; He begetteth Me — there is no cause there. 6. λαὶ λίαν πρόκ.] ‘exceedingly handy.’ The μὲν is answered πρὸς δ πῶς ἀπ’. 7. K. ἔκτισέ με] Prov. viii 11. The Heb. word is kanah, not bara which is the word used in Gen. i 1. It signifies comparare; and prob. κτᾶσθαι (which is the rendering of Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion) is nearer to it than the LXX. κτίζειν. Cp. Bas. adv. Eun. ii 20. Into that question, however, Gr. does not enter. 9. τὴν τελ. παράπτωσιν] sc. Solomon's. 10. τῆς σοφίας αὐτῆς] ’of Wisdom itself,’ as distinct from that Person in whom all wisdom is gathered up and displayed. Delitzsch, commenting on the passage in Prov., says, "Wisdom is not God, but ’s; she has personal existence in the Logos of the N.T., but is not herself the Logos." Gr. further explains this Wisdom, to be ’the science, so to speak, and the artistic principle ὅκ’ which the universe is composed.’ Gr. intends to carefully the τεχν. λόγος from the person of ’the Word.’ 13. ἢ θάλασσα. . . ἢ ἄβυσσος] Job xxviii 14; cp. Is. xxiii 4. 14. οἱ οὐρανοί] ’s. xviii 2 (xix Ι).
footnote 1 διηγοῦνται b || 5 ’δε] καὶ e ΙΙ 6 ἔχει] ἔχοι df II 9 παντως] πάντας g || 11 εὑρίσκωμεν] ομεν a 1 ῥομφαία] Zech. xiii 7; cp  Jer, xlvii 6 μάχαιρα).  2.ὄρη κ. βουνοὶ] Ps. cxiii (cxiv) 6. 3. εἰ καί τισι τῶν πρὸ ἡμ.] He prob. refers to Basil, who, in the Hom. in Princ. Proverb. ἑ 3, where he has no controversial animus, expounds very strikingly the ’personification’ of that wisdom which speaks to us out of nature. Very likely other Catholic authors adopted the same view. Bas. himself, however, when in controversy with the Eunomians, gives the same account as Gr. does here (adv. Enn. iv p. 293 Ληπτέον οὖν . . . ἐπὶ τοῦ τὴν μορφὴν δούλου λαβόντος). That account, it may be added, is derived from Athanasius, who says (de Deer. Nic. Syn. p. 220 B), To δὲ πρόσωπον τοῦ μὲν σωτῆρός ἐστι, τότε δὲ λέγεται ὅτε λοιπὸν λαβὼν τὸ σῶμα λέγει κτλ. Cp. the fuller passage in Ath. Or. ii c. Ar. ἑ 44 f.; also Eus. adv. Marcell. ii 3. Among other expositors whom Gr. knew, Origen (de Princ. i 2) identifies Wisdom with the eternal Son, and, though he does not admit any imaginable period before the generation of Wisdom, thinks that Wisdom speaks of herself as having been created, inasmuch as she comtains in herself from the outset the beginnings and outlines of the creation that was to be. Denys of Rome on the other hand (in Ath. de Deer. Nic. Syn. Ρ. 232) dwells upon the various significations of the word κτίζειν in the Bible, and understands it here to mean ’appointing,’ ‘setting over the works which were made through ’ For another explanation, with which, however, Gr. was hardly likely to be acquinted, see nil. de Trin. xii 35 foil. 7. ἢ τοῦτο] ‘otherwise this;’ which is the ’cause’ of God, ’would be prior to God.’ 10. τὸ γεννᾷ με] Prov. viii 25. 11. μετὰ τῆς αἰτίας] ‘coupled with a mention of cause.’ 15. ἀλήθεια κ. κρίσις] Ps. ex (cxi) 7. These, which are the works of our salvation τοῦ σωθῆναι π. ἡμᾶς), are identified as ’the works’ with view to which Wisdom was ‘created.’
footnote 3. 10 κατεχομενους] -οις f 1. ἐχρίσθη θεότητι] Gr. falls again into the danger of Nestorian language, and speaks as if there were a created person (identified with the created ’Wisdom’) who was ’anointed with Godhead.’ mention of unction is so abrupt that I cannot help suspecting that in some version accessible to Gr. the word nissachti in Prov. viii 23 Ἱ was set ’) was translated ‘Ι was anointed.’ So the Heb. word understood by Fiirst, Bertheau, and others; but I know no other indication of such a rendering in any ancient version. 4. τὴν κάτω γ.] ‘His birth upon earth.’ 5. πλόον ἄληπτον] used instead of ἀληπτοτέρα bee. it implies more decidedly that ἡ κάτω γ. was itself ἄληπτος. 3. Under the same head come the texts tvhich speak of Him ἃς a Servant, vant, and make it a great thing for Him to be called a child of God. His Incarnation did indeed put Him in a state ὁ servitude; and it ὕας indeed α great thing for His manhood to be so united to God. 6. εὖ δουλ. πολλοῖς] Is. liii 11. 7. μέγα. . . παῖδα θ.] Is. xlix 6. From what follows, it seems that Gr. (and his opponents) understood παῖδα = τέκνον or υἱόν. 8. ἐδοὑλ. σαρκί] Gr. seems to be undecided whether to take πολ. λοῖς as neut., including σάρξ, λένεσις, πάθη, or as masc, viz. πᾶσιν οἶς κτλ. The ’Attic attraction’ οἶς misled De Billy into supposing that πᾶσιν likewise was neut. (omnibus illis per quae). It is difficult to determine whether the same mistake caused the copyists to write κατεχομένους, or whether Gr. himself neglected to complete the attraction by saying (as he should have done) κατεχομένοις. That Ue ’s translation is wrong is shewn by the absence of the article before κατεχομένους; if Gr. had meant ’and all those things whereby He hath saved those who were enslaved,’ he have said τοὺς κάτεχ’. In view of the preponderating authority for κατεχομένους, it seems best to retain it in the text, understanding it to be a construction ad sensum, agreeing with the οὓς which lies hidden in the attracted ὄις.
footnote 4 τὸ ὄνομα] om τὸ cef || 8 ὅτι kcu] om καὶ f 4. 16 ἀπωσθῆναι] αποσθηναι ac: ἀποστῆναι e || om τὴν ag 1. μεῖζον] in ref. to μέγα above. ib. θεῷ πλακῆναι] again has a Nestorian sound. 2. μίξεως] On this and similar words as applied to the Incarnation see Petavius de Inc. iii 2. ib. ἐπισκ. ἀνατολῇ] Luke i 78. Gr. prob. forgot the context of the words, and thought that they were used in the address of Gabriel to the B.V.M. or some such place. His meaning here is plainly that the human nature assumed by the Son of God was thus ’visited.’ 3. τὸ γεννώμενον ἅγ.] Luke i 35. 4. χαρισθῆναιαὐτῷ τὸὄ.] Phil, ii 9. 6."/&gt; πᾶν γόνυ... τῷ κενωθέντι] Phil. ii 10, 7. 7. γνῶναι π. οἶκον ’I.] Acts ii   The point, of course, lies in the ἐποίησεν. 9. ἐνεργ. τοῦ γεννήματος] ‘by the active operation of that which was Begotten? as distinct from the κτίσμα. Tαῦτα refers to the whole series from τί δὲ μεῖζον onwards. 4. No. 2. He must reign until. The word until does not always negative the extension of the alleged action beyond the time mentioned. And besides, Christ's reign is two-fold. It is absolute, even over the refractory; and it is progressive, over those who are made willing to submit, In the first sense it never ends, in the second it ends with the completion of the submission. 12. δεῖ γὰρ αὐτὸν β.] 1 Cor. xv 25. τοῦδε, ’such and such a time? ib. ὑπ’ οὐρανοῦ δ.] Acts iii 21. 13. τὴν ἐκ δεξίων κ.] Ps. cix (ex) 1.

footnote 5. 3 om θέω e || 11 Χριστος] ο χρ. bdf 5. The text speaks of the subjec-of the Son. It speaks of Him in us, or of us in Him. When we are wholly subject, then Christ, our becomes subject, and not before. And so far from our language implying that the Son at at present in α state of rebellion, it is He who brings about our sztbjectiou. So also when He cries Why hast Thou for-saken Me ? it is we who speak in His person . 1. σύναπτε] ‘ Connect with this.’ 2. τί, ληεις, ὡς] The words are those of the Eunomian, from τί to τὸν λόγον ; unless perh. the first question, τί λέγεις, is addressed to the Eunomian, in the sense, ‘ Why do you speak as if we made out that ’etc. The Catholic, of course, following St Paul, spoke of a future ’subjection’ of the Son to the Fation ther. The Eunomian, who wished to make out that the ’s position is always and necessarily a subHead, ordinate one, as being that of a creature, retorted, ’What? is He not subject now, but requires to be reduced to subjection, — although you make Him out to be God ? Such language is only suitable to a robber, or to a rival claimant of the Godhead.’ 5. κατάρα ἤκουσε] ’ bore the designation of α curse? Gal. hi 13. 6. ἁμαρτία] 2 Cor. v 21. ‘O αἴρων, John i 29. ib. ‘Αδὰμ...νέος] 1 Cor. xv 45 ; cp. Col. iii 9, 10. 8. κεφαλή] Eph. i 22 etc. 17. ὂ κ. πρ. εἴπομεν] ἑ 3 sub fin.
footnote 1 ἐγκατέλειπες a || 3 ἑαυτοῦ] αὐτοῦ ac 1. ὁ θεός, 6 θεός μου] Ps. xxi 2 (xxii 1) ; cp. Matt, xxvii 46. 3. ὂ δοκεῖ τισίν] to some of the Docetic sects. See Evang. Petri § 5 ἢ δύναμίς μου, ἢ δύναμις, κατέλείψας με. 5. τὴν ἀρχήν] ‘ to begin with, ‘ at all? 6. τυποῖ τὸ ἤμ’.] ’ represents us.’ 9. ἀφροσύνην...πλημμελω vs. 3 καἰ οὐκ εἰς ἄνοιαν ἐμοί ; vs. 1 οἱ λόγοι τῶν παραπτωμάτων μου. 11. εἰκοστbςπρ] The numbering of the Pss. in the LXX. differs from that in the Hebrew. 6. His learning obedience, His strong crying and tears, are a sacred in which He represents us, entering into a full realisation of οἶσ’ circumstances. He learns by personal experience to be lenient to our falls. When the text in question proceeds to say that God will be all in all, it does not mean the Father as distinguished from the Son, but the Godhead as α whole. 13. μαθεῖν] Heb. v 8 ; cp. vs. 7. 16. δραματουργεῖται] ‘ It ἲς a drama, wonderfully constructed for our advantage.’ ’The saint,’ says Elias, ’ applies the name of a drama to that which our Saviour endured as representing mankind. He does not mean that it was unreal and fictitious, like other dramas; but only that Christ impersonates and plays the part of the human ’ i.e. not the part which belongs perly to His eternal and divine self. 17. τῶν). ὒ. χεῖρα τ.] The apart from the Incarnation, was neither obedient nor disobedient. Such language applies only to subjects and inferiors. Τὸ μέν, sc. ὑπήκοος; τὸ δέ, ἀνῆκ’.
footnote 6. 2 om καὶ δούλοις c || 11 ἑαυτοῦ] οἰκείοις b 2. δούλου μορφὴ] Phil, ii 7. 3. μορφ. τὸ ἀλλότριον] ’assumes a form which is not His own.’ 4. δαπανήσῃ] ‘consume,’ and so ‘destroy.’ Cp. ἑ 18 δαπανητικὸν τῶν μοχθηρῶν ἕξεων; v 10 δαπανώμενον. 6. ἔργω not merely by precept. 8. διὰ τ. πρ. χώρ’.] i give it practical effect' ; lit. ’proceed by way action.' 10. δοκιμάζει] ’is applying a test to’; not in the usual sense, by temptation of us, but by Himself experiencing what temptation must be to us. So He takes a measure of all that we go through, by means of His own sufferings. It may seem as if κἀκεῖνο were but a repetition of what had already been said in ἔργῳ τιμᾷ τ. ὑπακ. κ. πειρᾶται ταύτης. The difference is that in the earlier sentences Gr. speaks of us as represented by Christ ; we suffer, as it were, and obey in Him. Here he states the converse truth, that Christ identifies His lot with ours; He enters into our experiences in order to know at first hand what obedience on our part costs. 11. τέχνῃ φιλανθρ.] by a which His love of man (Tit. iii 4) suggested. 12. ποσὸν μὲν ἀπαιτ.] De Billy translates quantumque et a nobis exigi et condonari debeat, which gives the required sense, but is grammatically impossible. If πόσον be read, the only possible meaning is that Christ learns by practical experience what is demanded of us and what allowance is made for us. This, however, is unsatisfactory, so far as συγχωρ. is concerned. It is best to read ποσόν, and to make ἀπαιτ., συγχωρ., independent verbs coordinate with δοκιμ., μετρεῖ. They thus express the result of ’s gracious experiment ; ‘ and a certain ἲς still made upon us, and a allowance is now made ὂν us, our infirmity being taken into account along with what we have to bear.’ 14. τὸ φῶς...σκοτίᾳ] John i 5.
footnote 4 ἐκείνου διαφυγ.] κἀκείνου φυγόντος b || καὶ] γε df 1. διὰ τὸ πρόβλημα] ‘ because of the screen (or shade) ’ which partly concealed Him. The πρόβλημα was the fleshly nature which Christ assumed. If it had not been for that, the Evil One would not have ventured to ‘ persecute ’ Him. The thought is a favourite one with Gr. Cp. Or. xxiv 9 πεῖραν προσάγει τῷ ἀπειράστῳ, ἐπειδὴ δεύτερον Ἀδὰμ εἶδε τοῦ θεοῦ τὸ φαινόμενον, ὡς καὶ τοῦτον καταπαλαίσων· ἠγνόει γὰρ ὅτι περιπεσεῖται θεότητι, προσδραμὼν ἀνθρωπότητι. Or. xxxix 13 ἐπειδὴ γὰρ ᾤετο ἀήττητος εἶναι τῆς κακίας ὁ σοφιστής, θεότητος ἐλπίδι δελεάσας ἡμᾶς, σαρκὸς προβλήματι δελεάζεται, ἴν’, ὡς τῷ Ἀδὰμ προσβαλών, τῷ θεῷ περιπέσῃ. Or. xl 10 ἐάν σοι προσβάλῃ...ὁ τοῦ φωτὸς διώκτης καὶ πειπαστής, — προσβαλεῖ δέ, καὶ γὰρ καὶ τῷ Λόγῳ καὶ θεῷ μου προσέβαλε διὰ τὸ κάλυμμα, τῷ κρυπτῷ φωτὶ διὰ τὸ φαινόμενον,—ἔχεις ᾦ νικήσεις. Cp. Greg. Nyss. Or. Cat. § 26 ἀπατᾶται γὰρ καὶ αὐτὸς τῷ τοῦ ἀνθρώπου προβλήματι ὁ προαπατήσας τὸν ἄνθρωπον τᾦ τῆς μονῆς δελεάσματι. See Lightfoot on Ign. Eph. § 19, and Petaviua de Inc. ii 5. 3. τὸ σκότος πόσον] διωχθήσεται. Τὸ σκ.=ἡμεῖς, cp. Eph. v 8. It is difficult to draw any distinction between σκότος and σκοτία ; but σκότος is more concrete, so to speak, and possibly in the preceding clause τοῦ πονηροῦ is intended for a gen. dependent upon σκοτίας, not in app. to it. 4. ποσῶς καὶ καταλ.] The word is chosen with ref. to John i 5. Although Christ escaped uninjured from the temptation, it is not wonderful, Gr. says, that we should (not only be ‘ persecuted ’ by the tempter but) even to some extent be ’overtaken.’ The wonder is that He should even have been subject to assault, not that we should fail under it. 7. ἐν ᾦ γὰρ π.] Heb. ii 18. 9. ξσται δέ ὁ θ. τὰ π.] 1 Cor. xv 28. Gr. resumes the discussion from § 4. τῆς ἀποκ. , Acts iii 21. 11. οὐχ ὁ π.] Gr. will not allow that ὁ θεὸς here = ὁ πατήρ, as otherwise it would suggest that the Son is ’resolved’ again into Him, in Sabellian fashion, — like a brand snatched for a time out of a great burning pile and then joined to it again.

Elias seems to tke παραφθ. in a deponent sense, but without authority. 2. ὅλος θεός] God in the most unrestricted sense. Exegetically Gr. is no doubt wrong: ὁ θεός, as usual, means the Father, to whom the Son Himself has just been said to be made subject. But his suggestion of the way in which the great result will be brought about is full of beauty. 3. κινήμασι] motions of will, like κίνησις in iii 2. 5. ὅλοι θεοειδεῖς] not = πάντες θ. He means that we shall be entirely Godlike, Godlike through and through, capable of taking in all God and nothing but God. 6. ἡ τελ. πρὸς ἢν σπ] Perh. a ref. to Heb. vi 1. 8. περιορίζει X.] ’definitely ἃς. signs to Christ.’ ib. ὅπου οὐκ ἔνι] Col. iii n. St Ρ. is not here speaking of the future, but of the present. 7, Νο. 3 and 4. — The Father is greater; My God and your God. He is greater inasmztch as the Son springs from Him, — the Son who elsewhere is called His equal ; it implies no superiority of nature. 12. μεῖζον] John xiv 28. The use of the neut. does not imply that Gr. found it in his text of St John, where it would convey a wholly false impression. It is used in an abstract way, as it is used six lines below, τὸ μεῖζον μέν ἐστι κτλ. ib. θεόν μου] John xx 17. 15. γεννάδαι] iron, ’these fine gentlemen.’

If it is not an impossibility, we must suppose that the word ’greater’ refers to causation, and ’equal ’ to nature. 3. ὑπὸ π. εὐγν.] an idiomatic use of the prep., similar to that after a pass. verb. Cp. v 33. ib. ἡμεῖς] ‘ we ’ as distinguished from the ἄλλος τις. 4. ἡμετέρῳ] Although most of the best MSS. read ὑμ., that reading seems to a misunderstanding. Gr. has just admitted ὁμολογ. ἡμεῖς) that the Father is greater than the Son by reason of being His αἰτία. Some one else, he says, of course on the orthodox side, might find fault with for the admission, and urge that in this case no manner of inferiority attaches to being ’caused’ and not ’cause.’ As Gr. has already (iii II ) made the remark in his own person, it is only a rhetorical device to put it here in the mouth of another. The rendering of De Billy, ’ monem nostrum acriori animi conib. tentione prosequens, not only misunsibility, derstands the argument, but does violence to the meaning of προσφιλ. 9. τοῦ κατὰ τὸν ἆ. νοουμ.] ’than our Lord regarded as ’ lit. ’than Him who is considered according to the ’ i.e. the man that is in Him. It is another instance of that inexact language by which some fathers speak of ’the God ’ and ’the Man’ in Christ, meaning the Goddue head and the Manhood. Cp. just below the contrast between ὁ Λόγος and ὁ ὁρώμενος. 10. τί γάρ τὸ θαυμαστόν] See Westcott’s note in loc. 8. He is our Saviour's God, beme cause of our Saviour ’s humanity.

footnote 2. ἐπ’ ἀμφοῖν] In regard to both natures in Christ a term is properly applied and a term improperly. The same is true with regard to us; one term is properly applied in regard to us and the other improperly: but the term properly applied in regard to Christ is applied improperly in regard to us, and vice uversa. The term God (in θεός μου καὶ θ. ὑμῶν) is improperly applied in regard to Christ as God, and properly in regard to Christ as man and to us. The term Father is properly applied to Christ as God, and improperly to Christ as man and to us. 5. ἡ τῶν ὀν. ἐπίζευξις] The communicatio idiomatum. Gr. is not thinking only of the particular text, or of the words ‘God’ and ‘Father.’ 7. ταῖς ἐπινοίαις] Cp. iii 13, which shews that ταῖς ἐπ. is to be taken with συνδ., not with διιστ. ‘When the natures are mentioned separately, the nomenclature follows the distinction of the sense.’ 8. ἵνα ὁ θεός] Eph. i 17. 9. X. μὲν θεός, τῆς δὲ δ. π.] An interpretation as uncritical as it is doctrinally precarious. It rests upon the assumption that δόξα is the offspring in respect of which the Father is Father, and not (as in 1 Cor. ii 8, Jam. ii 1, 1 Pet. iv 14) an epithet; and the contrast which it draws between the personal name of the Incarnate Lord, and the ‘glory’ which is assumed to be His Divine Nature, is unsound. 11. οὐ τῇ φύσει] So Gr. rejects the yet unborn heresy of Eutyches. It might, however, have been still better if he had said τὸ συναμφ. εἷς. The ἕν, of course, means ‘a single whole.’ 9. No. 5.—Life, power, etc. are given to Him. This too is because He is Man. But it would be equally true of Him as God; it does not imply that these are given Him at some point subsequent to His eternal generation. 13. λεγέσθω] ‘be counted’ = ἀρίθμει in § 7. ib. λαμβάνειν] ζωήν John v 26; κρίσιν ib. 22, 27 ; κληρ. ἐθνῶν Ps. ii 8; ἐξ. π. σαρκός John xvii 2; δόξαν in the context seems to point to John xvii 1, 5, but cp. 1 Pet. i 21, 2 Pet. i 17; μαθητάς John xvii 6.

And sometimes ‘cannot’ denotes what is unthinkable, α logical absurdity. It denotes ’νθ’ limitation of power to say that God cannot οἱ evil. This is what the text means. He does not see the Father act and then imitate His action, making for example α world apiece. His action is not similar, but identical, to that of the Father, only the initiative rests with the Father. The sustaining of what is already created is α part of this common action of Father and Son. 2. ἀνεπίδεκτον] ‘ inadmissible ’ or ‘ unthinkable ’ ; almost ’ impossible in the sense of unthinkable.’ 3. ἢ μὴ εἶναι] ‘ or not to exist.’ ib. τοῦτο γὰρ ἀδυναμίας ἂν εἴη] See Petavius de Deo Deique Propr. v 7, and the passages there cited. 7. πάντα γὰρ δσα] John xvi 15. 8. ὡς ξμπαλιν κτλ.] John xvii 10. 9. αὐτὸ τὸ elvai κοινόν] ’ Their very being is common and equal, although the Son has it from the Father.’ 10. ἐγὼ ζῶ δ. τ. π. ] John vi 57. 12. συνεχομνοο] ‘ kept from ’ It seems a slight difficulty that in John vi 57 our Lord seems to refer not so much to the origination of His being as to something which may be compared to the continual sustenance of life καὶ ὁ τρώγων με κἀκεῖνος ζήσει δι’ ἐμέ). But on the other hand, so far as we know, the distinction between the original gift and the maintenance of life does not exist in the case of the Eternal Son, but belongs only to temporal existence. With Him nasci and pasci are the same. On the whole this interpretation is better than to translate συνεχ. ’restricted,’ ‘confined.’ 12 ὑπάρχ. ἀχρόνως] instead of being sustained by a succession of temporal acts. 13 καὶ ἀναιτίως] It is difficult to assign a meaning to the word in this connexion. Gr. has frequently affirmed that the Father is the αἰτία of the Son. It must therefore mean ‘ without any intermediate or secondary cause.’ ib. βλέπει δὲ...πῶς λ́τλ.] ‘ In what sense docs He see the Father doing, and do likewise?’

footnote 1 την ων] των ων b || πεποιηκεν bdf || 6 συνεχεις a 1. τὴν . . . οἰκονομίαν] The only grammatical construction for these words is to attach them to κατὰ τὴν τ. ἐ. ὁμοτιμίαν, treating καὶ τοῦτο ἂν εἴη κτλ. as parenthetical. Τῆς ἐξουσίας will then be not merely ‘of power,’ but ‘of the power’ displayed in the making of τὰ γινόμενα :—for it is clear that Gr. understands ποιεῖν here chiefly of ‘making’ rather than ‘doing.’ He then adds that it is not only in respect of equality of power in creating that the Son is said to make or do ‘like wise’ whatever the Father makes or does, but in respect also of ordering and sustaining what He has made or done. 2. ποιεῖσθαι τοὺς ἁ . . . . πν.] Ps. ciii (civ) 4. Cp. what he has said on this text ii 31. The point is that the present is used, where the past would have been expected. The power which first made the angels spirits is still said to make them so. 3. θεμελιοῦσθαι] Ps. ciii (civ) 5, where Gr. evidently read the present, ὁ θεμελιῶν. Ἡδρασμένα in ref. to the earth, γενόμενα in ref. to the angels. 4. στ. βροντήν] Am. iv 13. Here the point seems to lie not only in the tense, but in the using, with regard to transient things like thunder and wind, such words as στερεοῦν, κτίζειν (to found). The explanation is that the ‘law’ or ‘principle’ of them (λόγος) was laid down once for all, though the activity which produces them continues. 12. No. 7.—I came down not to do Mine own will, but the will of Him that sent Me. At first it looks as if this were said of the Manhood; for the human will does not always find it easy to conform to the divine. The cry in Gethsemane is a proof of it. But as it was only the divine nature which came down , the will cannot be the human will. Well, sentences of this kind do not always imply the existence of the thing whose activity is denied, but quite the opposite. The Son has no will of His own to do, apart from the Father’s. 7. καταβεβηκέναι] John vi 38. 9. τοῦ κατεληλ. αὐτοῦ] neut.; sec below, τὸ κατεληλυθός. 10. ὡς παρὰ τοῦ ἁ.] ‘that the expression took this form as proceeding from the Man (see note on § 7), not from the Saviour regarded αἰ such.’

The ὑπὸ has its full significance. ib. θεωθὲν ὅλον] It is strange that Gr. should allow himself to speak of the will of the Divine Son as having been ’ deified ’ (or ’ taken possession of by ’), which might imply that except for some action of God upon it, the ’s will was not divine. It does not wholly remove the difficulty to say that the ’time ’ when that action took place is, like the ’generation’ of which it is one aspect, before and above time. 2, τοῦ καθ’ ἡμᾶς] sc νοουμένου ; ‘considered according to us ’ means ‘considered as man.’ 3. ἀντιπίπτοντος] The human will of Christ, ace. to no was no exception to the rule; though, as his next quotation shews, it ceased to struggle when it was assured what ’s will was. 5. πάτερ, εἰ δὺν.] Matt, xxvi 39 ; Luke xxii 42. 8. ἐκεῖνον] i.e. τὸν κατὰ τὸν σωτῆρα νοούμενον. 9. παρὰ τοῦ προσλαβόντος] the Divine Son, as opp. to τὸ πρόσλῆμμα, the nature which He assumed. ‘Ο λόγος is John vi 38, not the cry in the Garden. 11. οὐχ ὡς ὄντος] ’it does not imply that the Son has a will of His own, distinct from the ’s, but that He has not.’ 13. τὸ συναγόμενον] the meaning gathered from the words. 16. ἀπὸ κοινοῦ λέγ.] From the illustrations which Gr. proceeds to give, it seems clear that the phrase ἀπὸ κ. is used without any ref. to τὸ κοινόν immediately before. With the possible exception of the first, they have nothing to do with the peculiar ‘ community ’ which exists between the Father and the Son. We must therefore suppose that ἀπὸ κοινοῦ is an adverbial expression with a wider meaning. It is, however, difficult to seize the exact force of it. Elias appears to have thought that it meant ’ in α way that common intelligence discerns.' It prob. means ’in a general way,' as distinguished from a pedantic adaptation to special situations. Cp. κατὰ κοινοῦ § 13.
footnote 1 λέγονται b || 3 πάρα θεοῦ θέω ab || 9 om ειτουν ἀποκαταστάσεως cfg 1. καἰ οὐ θετικῶς] This is added to bear out the assertion οὐχ ὡς ὄντος, ἀλλ’ ὡς οὐκ ὄντος. The point lies in this, that while the sentence, rigidly analysed, implies the existence of a fact, though it rejects an inference drawn from the fact, the speaker’s intention is to deny the fact as well as the inference. Thus οὐ γὰρ ἐκ μέτρου κτλ. implies that the Spirit is ‘given,’ though not ‘by by measure ’ ; but in reality it does not affirm the giving, any more than the measuring. Again, οὔτε ἢ ἁμαρτία μου κτλ. implies that the Psalmist was guilty of sin, though that guilt was not the cause of the opposition which he en-countered ; but the Psalmist has no intention of affirming his own sin. Again, οὐ διὰ τὰς δίκ’. ἤμ’. implies that we have righteousnesses, though we claim nothing on the ground of them ; but St Paul would never admit that we have any. Similarly, ’not Mine own will, but Thine’ implies the existence of a will of the Son, apart from the ’s ; but if we consider the expression ἀπὸ κοινοῦ, in a broad way, in view of the common use of language, we see that no assertion of the kind is intended. ib. οὐ γὰρ ἐκ μέτρου] John iii 34. In the explanatory sentence θεός and θεῷ make equally good sense. Gr. prob. understood the text as the A.V. does, supplying ’unto Him.' But pern, the very fact that this was the common intgerpretation caused θεός to be changed into θεῷ. 4. οὔτε ἢ ἁμαρτί] Ps. lviii 4 (lix 3). 5. οὐ διὰ τὰς δίκ’. ἤμ’.] Α combination of Dan. ix 18 with Tit. iii 5. 7. δῆλον δὲ τοῦτο] Gr. returns to the discussion of John vi 38 foil. 9. eh οὑν ἀποκατ.] Gr. adds this gloss, because in one sense unbelievers also have an ἀνάστασις.

The ἐπεὶ carries us somewhat abruptly back to the main thesis of the section, οὐχ ὡς ὄντος κτλ. 6. καὶ παντὸς τοῦ εὐγν] sc. ὁ λόγος. This is the usual interpretation of the fathers. 13. ’λθ’. 8. — Thee the only true God and Jesus Christ, and There is none good but one, that is, God. There are other instances where similar language does not exclude the Son. Here, it is used to exclude the false gods, and it is the common Godhead of the Father and of the which is addressed as the only true God. The other text is an answer to one who, thinking Him to be only a man, called Him ‘good’; whereas the goodness was that of the Godhead. If this argument does not satisfy them., we can find them a text which, on their principles, would prove the Son alone to be God. 8. ἵνα γινώσκωσι σέ] John xvii 3. 10. οὐδεὶς ἀγαθός] Mark x 18. 12. τὴν αὐτοαλήθειαν] viz.

Cp. § 4. 6. κατὰ κοίνου] Something like ἀπὸ κοινοῦ in § 12, ‘ in general.' Of course τῆς θεότ. depends upon ἢν, not upon κατὰ κ. Gr. does not perceive what difficulties he is landed in, if he makes ’Jesus Christ' address the Godhead in general as His sender. Both Nestorianism and Sabellianism are near at hand. ἀπάντησιν ἔχει πρός] ‘is intended ἃς an answer to?

The 1st pers. is used because ex hypothesi Gr. has been converted (νικήσειε) to the view which he opposes. 14. No. 9. — To make intercession for us.

No. 10 — The Son knoweth not the last day or hour. Obviously the Wisdom through whom the worlds, or ages, were made cannot be ignorant of the length of their duration ; and our Saviour's s prophecies concerning the last things shetv that He knew. You cannot know how the day ends without knowing how the night begins. He knew therefore as God, and knew not as man. The title of the Son, standing by itself, lends itself to this supposition. 12. μηδένα γινώσκειν] Mark xiii 32. 15. ὁ π. τῶν αἰώνων] II Heb. i 2.

The question only asks how such an one could be ignorant of anything ; but the titles by which He is here spoken of have ref. to this particular thing.

The expression is both idiomatic and forcible, to denote what happens right up to the very moment of the end ; and, as Jahn points out, in his notes on Elias, the word οἶον would go more naturally with it than with the tamer ἐν χρόνῳ. The reading ἐν χρόνῳ may easily be attributed to an early copyist unfamiliar with the phrase ἐν χρῷ, wno thought it an abbreviation for ἐν χρόνῳ. 9. συνεισάγει] ‘implies,’ ‘involves’; cp. iii 16. 11. τὸ φαῖν’. χωρίσῃ τοῦ ν.] τὸ νοούμενον may so naturally be used in contrast with τὸ φαῖν’., as ’the unseen' to ’the seen,' that probably Gr. must be understood to mean by the first the Lord's human nature, and by τὸ νοούμ. the divine. So Elias takes it. But it might be possible to take τὸ φ. = ‘ the look ’ of the saying, and τὸ νοούμ. = ‘ the meaning? Α casual reader, looking only at τὸ φ., would think that an absolute ignorance was predicated ; but attentive examination would shew that that is not τὸ νοούμενον. 12. τὸ γὰρ ἀπόλυτον κτλ.] The γὰρ justifies the assertion εὔδηλον. ‘ For the fact that the title of " the Son " stands absolutely and without conditions, nothing being added to say whose Son, suggests to us this interpretation ; so that we put the more reveiwit construction tipon the ignorance, and attribute it to the human nature, not to the divine.' Ἄσχετον is used in a remarkable way, as if from σχέσις, ‘ ’ In the light of later criticism, the fact which Gr. notices may be thought to tell in the opp. direction : the absolute title seems to denote the eternal relation, not the temporary condition. See ’s note in his St Mark p. 297. Gr. takes the argument, as well as the illustrations of τεῖχος, νύξ, from Ath. οἱ. iii c. Ar. § 43, who says that if it had stood ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ θεοῦ, it would have implied that the Godhead did not know, but that ὁ υἱός allows us to suppose that the ignorance is that τοῦ ἐξ ἀνθρώπων γενομένου υἱοῦ.

The observation holds true, even if we do not accept Basil's account of the particular passage μηδὲ ἐκείνως ἀναγνούς). 11. ἢ ὡς δ́τι ö π.] ’ except in so far as He does so because the Father does.’ 12. τὸ συναγόμενον] Cp. § 12. The rgument is not very clear ; but the ὡς δῆλον appears to give the reason, not for the Son's knowing, but for the Son's knowing it from the Father. Nothing but the πρώτη φύσις can know, therefore the incarnate Son could not obtain the knowledge in any other way than from the Father.

We must premise that God cannot be named. The reticence of the Hebrews testifies to this. No name that we can give can express all that God is. 19. ἀκατονόμαστον] ‘can have no name.’ 21. ὅσον εἰκ. ἔδοσαν] We are not directly informed what was the original purpose of the custom to which Gr. is about to refer ; we can only conjecture.

Gr.'s account of the matter somewhat confused. While it is well known that the Jews never pronounced the name, there seems to be no ground for saying that it was written in a peculiar script. 3. ἀκοινώνητον] ‘ not right that God should be put on a level us. ’ 5. λυομένη] Cp. ii 13. The sound is uttered and melts away and perishes ; it is therefore unsuitable for expressing the indissoluble, imperishable nature of God. 6. ἰδιάζουσαν] This epithet is added in a not strictly logical position. The fact that God's nature is unique is no reason why it should not be expressed in fleeting sounds. The word is added in ref. to the custom mentioned, of using a special character. 8. περὶ αὐτόν] contrasted with κατ’ αὐτόν. For Gr.'s use of περί with ace. see iii 10, 12. Certain facts in connexion with God are known to us, and from these we dimly and tentatively draw for ourselves pictures of what He actually is. 9. ἄλλην ἀπ’ ἄλλου] We put our mental image together, deriving part of it from one quarter, part from another. 11. ὁ δεσμός] Elias is, no doubt, right in understanding the bond which binds the soul to the body.

The tract de Definitionibus, printed among the works of Athanasius from which it is quoted by Suicer, is of later date. 8. δαπανητικόν] Cp. § 6. ib. πῦρ καταναλ.] Heb. xii 29 ; Deut. iv 24. 9. ἀλλ’ οὖν τῶν πρός τι λ. ἑ.] ’ is nevertheless a relative word, not absolute one.'

Gr. does not in these words mean to describe a property which distinguishes the divine nature from others. It is a common property of all natures. ‘Man,’ for ex., is not the name of a relationship, but of a substantive thing ; while ’husband,’ ’slave,’ 'Cappadocian, ’ which express a relationship, are not the names of a nature. 14. ἴδιον ὄντως θεοῦ] so ἐστίν. What we are in quest of, we find in the name ὁ ὤν ; for τὸ ὂν is the special property of God, and belongs to Him in its entirety, not partially, as it does to other beings, who only have a share in existence. It is a little surprising that Gr. does not say τὸ δὲ εἶναι, instead of τὸ δὲ ὄν. Perhaps it is because he has used τὸ εἶναι immediately before in a somewhat different sense (viz. of what a thing is, rather than that it is) ; and whereas τὸ εἶναι represents existence as a purely conceptual thing, τὸ ὂν represents it as actually existing, and so is better suited to denote the fulness of the divine nature.

Other titles signify His power, like Almighty, King, Lord ; others belong to His revelation of Himself in history, such as God of vengeance, of salvation, of righteousness. All these are common to the Three Persons, each of whom has His special appellation. Those of the Son arc as follows. 4. οἰκονομίας] Cp. iii 18. They are ’dispensational’ names, whether proper to the ’dispensation’ of the Incarnation, or independent of it. 5. οἶον ὁ μὲν π.] Titles of ἐξουσία: ‘ the Almighty, and King, — whether οφ Glory, or θ’ etc. Παντοκράτωρ, as is evident from the context, is correctly used as= ’Master of all.’ 6. τῆς δόξης] Ps. xxiii (xxiv) 7. ib. τῶν αἰώνων] 1 Tim. i 17 (cp.

The reading ἢ τοῦ ἀγαπητοῦ in the mss. of Gr. may be a trace of a longer reading τῶν δυνάμεων τοῦ ἀγαπητοῦ, ἢ τοῦ ἀγαπητοῦ, which would treat the second τοῦ ἂγ. in the Ps. as parallel to τῶν δὺν., not to the first τοῦ ἂγ. ib. τῶν βασιλ.] 1 Tim. vi 15. 8. ὀ κύριος, ἢ σαβαώθ] ’and the Lord, of Sabaoth, i.e. of Hosts, or of etc. Σαβαώθ is used about fifty times in Isaiah (LXX.), four times in 1 Kings (1 Sam.), and once in Zech.; cp.

footnote 1 θέον] + και b || 2 επειδη] επει b || 9 om ουν b 1. παντὸς Ἰσραήλ] Ps. lxvii 9, 36 (lxviii 8, 35). The epithets are Gr.'s own addition, intended to interpret the phrase. Ὁρῶντος θεόν seems to be introduced in ref. to the circumstances in which Jacob’s name was changed (Gen. xxxii 30). 2. τρισὶ τούτοις] The three things are (1) fear of punishment, (2) hope of salvation and of glory, (3) practice of virtues. It might seem a more logical classification to make the third the ‘hope of glory,’ the ‘practice of virtues’ being added to shew how the motives which Gr. has mentioned act. But this is forbidden by the τὸ δὲ τῶν ἀρετῶν below. Διοικούμεθα therefore is used in a somewhat different sense with ἀσκήσει from what it is with δέει and ἐλπίδι. We are governed by two great prevailing motives, and on one great moral principle. 4. ἀσκ. τῶν ἀρ. ἐξ ὧν τ.] ‘the practice of the virtues which result in these.’ Ταῦτα sc. σωτηρία and δόξα. 5. τῶν σωτηρίων] Ps. xxvii (xxviii) 8, lxvii 20 (lxviii 19), lxxxiv 5 (lxxxv 4). It is prob. the plur. of σωτήριον, and not to be written σωτηριῶν. 6. τῶν ἀρετῶν] sc. δικαιοσύνης, εἰρήνης. ib. ἵν᾿ ὡς τὸν θεόν κτλ.] Α comparison of what is said of Enos in ii 18 would suggest that τούτων τι means the φόβος and the ἐλπίς. Α man who carries within him the presence of the God of vengeance and of salvation, and thus attains to some measure of fear and hope, is spurred on to seek moral perfection and the kinship with God which comes of it. This gives more point to the sentence than if ἄσκησις itself is included in τούτων τι. 8. οἰκείωσιν] Cp. ii 17 τῷ οἰκείῳ. 9. ἔτι] ‘so far.’ 13. ὡρμήθη λέγειν] ‘meant at the outset to say.’ Cp. ii 11. 20. He is the Son, Only begotten, Word, Wisdom, Power, Truth, Image, Light, Life, Righteousness, Sanctification, Redemption, Resurrection.

Cp. iii 4. 4. πρὸς νοῦν λόγος] ‘ His relation to the Father is that of word to mind.’ ib. διὰ τὸ ἀπαθές] i.e. to indicate that when He is called Son, there is nothing of ‘ passion ’ in His generation. The title of ’Word’ does more than this; it indicates the abiding connexion between the Word and God, — for mind and word are inseparable, — and also the fact that He gives expression to the mind of God. 6. ὄρος] ‘definition, for λόγος is used in this sense also.' xxxviii 13 ὀ τοῦ πατρὸς ὅρος καὶ λόγος. 7. ὁ γὰρ νεν. . .ἐωρακώς] John xiv 9. 13. λόγφ συνόστηκεν] λόγοςο takes a fresh shade of meaning, that of ’law’ or principle; as in λόγους ἀγνοεῖν immediately below. 15. δύναμις ] 1 Cor. i 24, where it occurs in conjunction with σοφία. 17. ἀλήθεια] John xiv 6. 19. σφραγίς] Cp. iii 17. 20. χαρακτῆρι Heb. i 3. ib. εἰκών] 2 Cor. iv 4, Col. i 15.

Κινουμένου suggests that Gr. understood εἰκών to apply only to pictures or effigies of persons. 5. τὸ ἀπαράλλακτον] Παραλλαγή would express the slight variations that occur in all cases of human copying, or in the course of generations. There is ‘ less ’ of such variation in the ’s representation of His Father, than there was when Adam begat Seth κατὰ τὴν ἰδέαν αὐτοῦ καὶ κατὰ τὴν εἰκόνα αὐτοῦ (Gen. v 3). By ’less’ Gr. of course means that there is none. 6. τῶν ἁπλῶν] such as God’s. 7. τῷ μέν...τῷ δέ] not here the dative of comparison, but kin this particular, and in that.’ 8. ταὐτὸν μ. ἢ ἀφομ.] ’ identical rather than like.’ 9. φῶς] John i 9 etc. ib. λόγῳ] Gr. seems to mean rather the reasoning mind, which takes account of truth, than speech; ’ cleansed in mind and life. ’ This is shewn by the parallels ἄγνοια, γνῶσις, which follow. 11. ζωή] John xi 25 etc. He is Life, just because, as has been shewn, He is Light. 12. οὐσί ὦσις] ’ the giving of being. ’ He is that by virtue of which all reasonable creatures have permanence and substantive existence. ib. ἐν αὐτῷ γάρ] Acts xvii 28. The words are not said of the Son. 14. καὶ πνοήν...καὶ πν.ἅγ.] Gen. ii 7, John xx 22. Ἐκεῖθεν in the same way as at the beginning of the § All of us have received from Him the ‘ breath of life ’ ; as many as are capable of it have received the Holy Spirit, in measure proportioned to our receptivity.

Cp. ii 6. ib. δικαιοσύνη] 1 Cor. i 30. Gr. does not see in the passage any ref. to justification. Christ is ‘righteousness’ inasmuch as He awards in all cases what is meet and right. As examples of such award, He mentions the judging justly between those under the law and those under grace, and between soul and body. Διαιτᾷν with the dat. is 'to arbitrate for or between.' By arbitrating between those under law and grace respectively, Gr. prob. meant that in the final settlement of rewards and punishments account will be taken of the opportunities which each man has enjoyed in life. 3. ψυχῇ κ. σώματι] Cp. i 7. 6. ἁγιασμός] 1 Cor. i 30. As being Himself all purity, lie cannot but sanctify those to whom He comes, in order that that which is pure, i.e. the revelation of God, may be received by purity, i.e. by souls which are characterized by it. 7. ἀπολύτρωσις] 1 Cor. i 30. 9. λύτρον] Mark x 45 ; cp. 1 Tim. ii 6. ib. τῆς οἰκ. καθ’] ‘ sufficient to cleanse the world.’ 10. ἀνάστασις] John xi 25. Ἐντεῦθεν = from this world.' Gr. does not seem to intend ἐντ’. ἤμ’. ἀπανιστάς to refer to the bodily resurrection. but to the spiritual and moral resurrection of which the next clause speaks. 21. The foregoing belong to Him both as God and as Man ; the following belong to Him as incarnate:— Man, Son of Man, Christ, Way, Door, Shepherd, Sheep, Lamb, High Priest, Melchizedck. He must be-thought ὁ ἃς God and Man, — as God unchanged in assuming the manhood. 12. ἔτι] as in § 19; ‘ thus far.’ ib. τοῦ τε ὑπὲρ ἡμ.] It would be quite in keeping with Gr.'s usage to make the τοῦ masc., ’Him who is above us and Him who came to be what He is for our sakes'; cp. § 7. But perhaps we may give Gr. the benefit of the doubt and take the word as neut., as it is below.

The effect of this is that that anointing power in Him bears the name of God, while that which it anoints is raised to Godhead. In. this statevisible ment we have the converse of that inexactness which has been referred to above. It is not really τὸ χρίον, strictly speaking, which is called man, but ὁ χρίων. 16. ὁδός] John xiv 6. 17, θύρα] John x 9. ib. ποιμήν] John x 11.

Gr. ends with something of a ’riddle,’ in order to fix his teaching in the memory. The words from Ἰησοῦς to σωματικῶς form the subject ; ὁ αὐτὸς πν. is the predicate. The interpr. which Gr. has just put upon the title χριστός must be borne in mind. He seems to take χθ. κ. σῆμ’ closely together, in the sense of ’recently ,' ’during these last few days,' — not, of course, like πρώην τε καἰ χθές, excluding the present, but including it. With σωματικῶς cp. Col. ii 9; the adverbs have no verbs to qualify, unless ὤν or ὑπάρχων be supplied. For πνευματικῶς = νοουμένας see WestCOtt on Heb. ix 14. The sentence is therefore: ’Jesus, anointed with the whole indwelling Godhead, who now for a few days has been in bodily form, is, considered according to the inward principle of His being, the same unchanged personality that He was before His incarnation, and will be so for ever.’
