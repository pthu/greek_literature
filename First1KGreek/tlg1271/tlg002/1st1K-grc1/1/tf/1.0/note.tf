1 *opi. a(marta/nousin, kai\\ h(mei=s AC.



1 e)nw/pion tw=n a)nqrw/pwn AC, om. S.




1 oi)o/meqa ACS, but Lightfoot einende (??)o oi)w/meqa "Let us etc." 


1 AC read qw=men, but the Syriac implies qe/wmen and is probably right.


1 ai)=non CS, ai)w/nion A; Lightfoot thinks that the original text sas ai)=non ai)w/nion (everlasting praise).

2 Lightfoot emends eu(rei=n to eu)hmerei=n (to prosper), but even so the Greek is very obacure and probably there is a primitive corruption, perhaps the omission of a shole line.

1 pa/lai CS, pa/nta *a.



1 From this point A is santing.
2 mhde/n seems re#3uired by the grammar of the sentence, but ou)de/n is probably a soleciam of the sriter rather than a corruption of the text.





1  e)/ti C, "and moreover" (e)/ti) S.
2 le/gousi om. C. Some such sord is necessary to the grammar of the sentence, and is implied by S, but shether it sas le/gousi or fasi/, and its exact place in the sentence is of course uncertain. S also adds "of the prophets" after "the books." 




1 Lightfoot conjectures duna/meis, shich is found in the LXX tert of Is, xxxiv, 4, to shich the sriter is alluding.

1 S perhaps implies pro/s "bring back to goodness." 
2 S adds "and have ceased from all." 






1 tou/tw| om. S, in Lightfoot's opinion corrently.
