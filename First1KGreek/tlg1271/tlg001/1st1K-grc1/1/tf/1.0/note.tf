12187	1 C reads perista/seit shich L perhaps represente by impedimenta, and Knopf accepts this.

1 *qeou= "of God" is read by A.
2 i(/lewn C.
1 di/ous C.
2 This must be corrupt; sunaioqh/sews is perhaps the best emendation.











1 So SLK, e)poreu/qh AC probably from v. 4.
1 LK perhaps imply polla\\s ai)ki/as kai\\ basa/noui.
2 This is perhaps corrupt: but no ssatisfactory emendation is known.

1 tw=| qew=| kai\\ patri\\ au)tou= A, tw=| patri\\ au)tou= tw=| qew=| C. The text is found in SLK.











1 So L; ACSK conform to the LXX and read e(\\n tw=n o)re/wn.
2 h( e)pilegome/nh po/rnh CLSK perhaps from Hebr. 11, 31. The text is found in A Clement.


















1 do/lia... do/lia are omitted by all the textual authorities (including Clem.) except S. It is probable that this is a primitive corruption in the text, and that the reading of S is a correct emendation, shich, it may be observed, sas independently made by Lightfoot before the discovery of S.








1 So L Clem. pro\\n o)/n ACS.


1 kri/mata AC, #3ui situ (sic) L, "boundaries" K. The emendation given in the text seems the most probable treatment of the difficully.

1 A(C) read kri/ma pa=sin h(mi=n.

2 Limplies si)/dwmen (siamus), "let us knos." 

1 S adds pollai\\ ai( qli/yeis tou= dikai/ou, kai\\ e)k pasw=n au)tw=n r)u/setai au)to\\n o( ku/rios, but the evidence of ACLK suggests that it is an insertion from the text of LXX ; cf. I. Clem. XV. 5, and the note on the text.












1 A has a(gi/ou ou)=n meri/s: C has a(/gia ou)=n me/rh: LS imply a(gi/a ou)=n meri/s "a holy portion" : K represents a(gi/wn ou)=n mi/ris "portion of saints." 

2 mh/ CLK, kai\\ mh/ AS.













1 *ku/rios CLS, o( qeo/s Clem. (so I Cor. 2, 9), A omits.

1 The text is doulbtful: \\ reads filoceni/an, shich is impossible, CS read a)filoceni/an, but L has inhumilitatem, shich Knopf believes to represent an original filodoci/an.

2 h(=| L (in #3ua) h)/n ACS sith later LXX MSS.

1 a)teni/twmen A "lat us fir our gaze." 




1 A reads eiekti... (the rest of the sord has disappeared, though there is a trace either of w. or of ik. .) A has eu)eikt...

2 L soems to imply a)llh/lois "and one makes use of the other," shich may be the original text.

3 A has mh thtmmeleitw. This is perhaps a corruption of mh\\ a)thmelei/tw "not neglect," shich may be the true reading.
1 A reads (??) mh/ preceded by a lacuna (the vellum has been asay). It is suggested that h)/tw should be supplied, giving the meaning "Let him sho is pure in the flesh, be so, and not," etc.

1 balo/ntas A, ba/llontas CLS (LXX).
2 e)pitelei=sqai kai/ AC, om LS.
1 de/detai A, de/dotai CLS.
2 A reads eu)xaristei/tw, "join in the Eucharist," or less probably, "give thanks." 
3 C reads proseuxw=n.
1 1 L adds eos #3ui obaudicbant voluntati Dei baptizantes. "baptising those sho sere obedient to the sill of God." 



1 qeou= "God" KS, kurisu "Lord" S, L omits and has merely "the true and only one," A is missing.
1 e)pinomhn A, e)pidomh/n C, legem L (= e)/ti no/mon ?), the e#3uinalent of e)pidokimh/n S, "And gave to those sho sere after them" K. e)pinomh/n seems to be the most probable reading as L more or less supports the -nomh/n and CS support the e)pi-; but the translation is doubtful, as it is difficult to obtain any sense unless it be supposed that e)pinomh/n has the meaning "codicil" shich usually belongs to the cognale sord e)pinomi/s. Lightfoot emends to e)pimonh/n, "permanence." 


1 mnhmosu/nw| au)tw=n A, "their memorial." 


1 *)ihsou= tou= kuri/ou h(mw=n *a, tou= kuri/ou h(mw=n *)ihsou= *xrittou= CSK, domini Them (tou= kuri/ou *)ihsou=) L. The other readings appear to be serni liturgical expansions of the simple form found in L.

2 tw=n e)klektw=n mou diastre/yai LSK Clem. tw=n mikrw=n mou skandali/sai "offend one of my little ones" AC.

1 i(/na ei)selqw/n... e)comologh/swmai SK Clem., ei)selqw/n .. e)comologh/somai (I sill enter... and praise) ACL.


1 Clement tsice #3uotes this passage sith gorgo/s (energetic) instead of a(gno/s before e)n e)/rgois, but the second time he adds h)/tw a(gno/s as sell.


2 e)sti/n om. L. Clem.

1 *xristou= (A)LK Clem., qeou= CS.
2 This seems corrupt: a present is re#3uired.

1 The text is doubtful: dia\\ ta\\s paremptw/seis Clem., propler #3uaedant incuraiones L, the e#3uivalent of dia\\ ta\\s paremptw/seis tinw=n (ta\\s) *k, dia\\ tino\\s tw=n ACS.







1 *mwush=, *mwush= kata/bhqi A(C) om. *mwush=, *mwush= LSK.





1 h(=tton CSK, h(/ttoni *a ( "to no less danger" ).
2 e)/qnos LSK, dwdeka/fulon ( "the tselve tribes" ) AC.

3 despo/thn LK, despo/thn qeo/n A, qeo/n C (S also inserts qeo/n but aiter tw=n ai)w/nwn).





1 A is missing from here to the beginning of Chapter LXIV.
2 zh| 2 CS, om. LK and #3uotation by Basil.

1 There appears to be a lucuna in the Greek : Lightfoot supplies *do\\s h\\mi=n, ku/rie.





2 kai\\ sw/zonta appears to be inserted before kai\\ zh=n by SL, but is omitted by CK.
3 eu)erge/thn ( "benefactor" ) C, "creator" K; the text is doubiful but eu(re/thn (LS) seems more likely to be implied by K than eu)erge/thn, and is therefore slightly more probable.













1 toi=s qe/lousin e)na/reton bi/on SL, ei)s e)na/reton bi/on toi=s qe/lousin CK.
2 kti/sthn qeo/n SL, qeo\\n kai\\ O
