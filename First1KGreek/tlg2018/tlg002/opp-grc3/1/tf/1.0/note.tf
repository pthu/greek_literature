footnote 1 That is, 1 Β.C., the next year being the annus D The same date is given by Clement οf Alexandria, Str but Irenaeus and Tertullian place the nativity οne year ea Νeither date can be reconciled with the statenlent οf Matt ii. 1 that Jesus was born in the reign οf Herod the G who died in 4 B.C. 2 Eusebius assumes that the census mentioned Josephus, which led to a revolt, is the same as that refe to in Luke and in Acts. If he be right Luke and Matt cannot be reconciled, for the census of Quirinius referred to by Josephus and also in Acts v. 37 was in A.D. 6. Sir W. Μ. Ramsay thinks that there may have been an earlier census in the reign of Herod during a former governorship οf Quirinius in Syria, which did not then include the domain οf Herod. There is good evidence for tbe former governorship of Quirinius, but none for a census in Judaea during his goveernorship by (or for) Herod. see Eusebius, Ecl. proph. 158 ff.

footnote 1 This is the only possible translation οf the Greel; but it appears to be a mistake in eopying on the part of Eusebius, and according to cod. q of the Quaestiones ad Stephanum (Mai, Noua patrum bibl. iv. 231 f.) Αfricanus wrote “ the deaths of the childless.” 2 The point οf this obscure argument is that among the Jews if a man died childless his brother was charged with the duty οf begetting children by the widow, who was still reckoned as the wife οf the deceaed. Such children were legally regarded as the sons of the dead brother, though known to be actually the children of the living one. This happened in the ease of Joseph. He was legally the son of Eli, physically of Jacob. Α further complication was that EIi and Jacob were only half brothers. They were the sons of the same mother, Estha, but Eli was the son of her second husband, Melchi, descended from Nathan the son of David, and Jacob was the son of her first huband Matthan, deseended from Solomon the son of David. Thu Μatthew giving the physical deeent οf Jesus traces it through Jacob to Solomon, but Luke (who avoids the word “ begat”) giving the legal descent traces it through Eli to Nathan. Matt. 1, 15.16

footnote 1 The word translated “ reports ’’ is used of official documents, such as the Acta Pilati claimed to be ; the Latin is commentarii — well known from its use by Caesar. The Acta Pilati now extant are Christian forgeries οf uncertain date. Those to which Eusebius refers were heathen forgeries introduced in the time οf the great persecution under Maximin. 2 Eusebius reckons the baptism οf Christ as taking place in the fifteenth year of Tiberius, dating his accession from the death of Augustus. As be was then in his thirtieth year he was born in the forty-second year of Augustus, fourteen years before his death. This is the reckoning of time known as the Christian era (see p. 46).

footnote 1 Eusebius has slightly altered the text οf Josephus. This ran : “ For Herod killed him, a good man and one who commanded the Jevs training thembelves in virtue and practising righteousness towards one another and piety towards God to together for baptism.” It would seem mean that John was preaching to ascetics and suggested baptism as a hnal act of perfection. This explains the reference to “ when the rest collected.” So long as preached to ascetics Herod did not mind but was disturbed when the rest οf the public manifested interest. Whiston's translation of Josephus and an unnecessary emendation in the text of Niese's edition of Josephus have conspired to obscure these fficts.

footnote 1 Eusebius is usually very accurate in his quotations, but here he varies from the tert of Josephus, who says “ he saw an owl sitting on a certain rope over his head, and at onee understood that it was a messenger ἄγγελος) of evil, as it had formerly been οf ” The allusion is to the story that when Αgrippa, at the loweSt ebb of his misfortunes, was in prison ln Rome he saw an οwl and regarded it as a harbinger οf better days, whieh did indeed soon come (Josephus, Ant. xviii. 6. 7).

footnote 1 Cf. George Syncellus 638, 3–641, 2. 1 The first part οf the quotation is from the Wisdom οf Solomon, not Isaiah. 2 This story is confused and improbaable. The text of Hegerippus must be corrupt, for Rechabim is only the Hebrew plural and merelyl repeats the previous phrase. Μoreover the rechabites were a tribe οf Kenites who ere adopted into israel (cf. 1 Chron. ii. 55 and Jer. XXXN. 19). There is no evidence that a Rechabite was ever counted as a Levite, or that the name was that of a sect to which a priest οr Levite could have belonged. Epiphanius (Haer. lxxviii. 14) replaces this mysterious Rechabite by Simeon the son of Clopas.

footnote 1 The point appears to be that the settlement of the lady's estate meant an accounting to her by her husband, and probably cosiderable payment by him to her, so that the situation was that if he wished to gratify his grudge against her he would have to pay more than he desired, while if she wished to escape a martyr's crown she must sacrifice some οf property to her husband. Justin's point of view is obvious, but the emperor may have thought that wives who refused to join in their husband's amusemenb Scarcely deserved to be executed yet might Well pay for the privilege of having failed to convert their husbands to their own vay or thinking.

Thc present limits οf Lent appear to have been Rxed in the seventh century. see ’s Dictionary ὁ Christian Antiquities, s.v. Lent.
footnote 1 That is, the Quartodeciman practice; sce note οn p. 503 2 The meaning appears to be that the previous generation of Romans had not nlade an issue οut οf the Quartodeciman practiee, even whcn Asiatics visiting Rome observed it. The difficulty can be seen best if it be remembered that the Quartodeciman praetice would sometimes mean that Asiatics treated as Easter day what the Romans regarded as Good Friday.
