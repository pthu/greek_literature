11448	footnote 1 ἀλλὰ καὶ πρὸς Ν. 1 Both here and below in § 6 Lucian omits as self-understood the point that Orestes discovers the priestess to be his sister Iphigenia, previously thought to have perished at Aulis under the sacrificial knife, 2 In the point that this version of the story makes the Greeks escape by overpowering the Scythians and killing Thoas, their king, it differs significantly both from Euripides in the Iphigenia among the Taurians and from Sophocles in the Chryses, in which Thoas was killed, to be sure, but only after they had somehow got away and he had overtaken them at “Sminthe,” whose ruler, Chryses, turning out to be the son of Agamemnon and Chryseis, and so the half-brother of Orestes and Iphigenia, aids them to kill their pursuer. Elsewhere in extant ancient literature the Lucianic version

Indeed, the existence of the paintings is practically guaranteed by two considerations: they represent a version of the story of Orestes among the Taurians that is not known to us prior to Lucian except in art; and that version, involving as it does his killing of the king, is not likely to have been preferred to the Euripidean by Lucian for his present purpose, if the paintings were imaginary. Here there seems to be a core of fact which Lucian can have derived only from sone previous writer; and we may perhaps also safely believe that the deified heroes obtained sufficient prestige among tha native part of the population of

footnote 1 There is no need to supply ἄνω (Hartman). The back-country (χώρα), Egypt, was a thing apart from Alexandria. In the report of a trial held at Alexandria occurs the statement: “Her brother is in Egypt, but will come soon” (Hunt, Select Papyri (L.C.L.), II, No. 263, l. 27; cf. l. 32).

footnote 1 Μακέτου N, and so in N throughout. 2 K. G. P. Schwartz proposed setting this sentence after the one that here, as in the MSS,, follows it. That would indeed greatly improve the sequence of thought, but is highly unsatisfactory from the palaeographical standpoint. The disturbance is probably a consequence of the abridgement to which Lucian subjected the story.

footnote 1 In the story as it came to Lucian, Lonchates and Macentes, before parting, must have arranged that the latter was to wait at some point (perhaps where their routes diverged) until the former should return with the news of his success. It would have been fatal to the plot against the king to have Adyrmachus bring to the city a false report of the king’s death before Lonchates was able to strike. Besides, a
