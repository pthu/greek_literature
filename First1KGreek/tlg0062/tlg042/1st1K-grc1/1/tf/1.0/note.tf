4985	footnote This piece is wanting in N and several other MSS. because it was in the Index Librorum Prohibitorum. It has been edited separately by Lionello Levi, with the readings of eight MSS., chief of which are Γ, X (Pal. 73, and M (Par. 2954). 1 The greeting here employed (its sense might perhaps be more adequately rendered by “Good issues to all your doings”) marks Cronius as a Platonist. Lucian himself (Lapsus, 4) ascribes its origin to Plato, and he employs it in addressing the philosopher Nigrinus (I, p. 98). Α Platonist named Cronius is more than once mentioned by Porphyry, but to identify the two would contribute next to nothing to our knowledge of either. 2 Cf. Aulus Gellius, XII, 11: philosophum nomine Peregrinum, cui postea cognomentum Proteus factum est, virum gravem et constantem, etc. Lucian calls him Peregrinus Proteus in Demonax, 21 (I, p. 156), but simply Proteus the Cynic in adv. Indoct., 14 (III, p. 192), and he is Proteus to

footnote 1 The phrase is F. D. Allinson's. 2 In Acts 15, 29 the apostles and the elder brethren prescribe abstaining “from sacrifices offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled” (εἰδολόθυτα καὶ αἷμα καὶ πνικτά). Probably what Lucian has in mind is pagan sacrificial meats. This may be just a guess, from the way he puts it; but if so, it is highly plausible on account of the

footnote 1 ἐλεύθερον 1. 1 Thanks to Paul Graindor, the date of the Olympiads mentioned in connection with Peregrinus can now be determined. He has deduced from the apparent ages of the children represented in the exedra erected by Herodes on the completion of his aquedct that this took place in A.D. 153 (Hérode Atticus et Sa Famille, pp. 87—88). His deduction finds support in the text of Lucian as soon as we recognise that Lucian is talking about four different Olympiads, not three. The first is that on which Peregrinus criticised the aqueduct, which will be the year of its completion, A.D. 153. At the next (τὴν ἑξῆς, A.D. 157) he withdrew his criticism. The Olympiad just after which he announced his intention of cremating himself need not and cannot be identical with

footnote 1 Athenagoras reports that Parium, where Peregrinus was born, cherished a statue of him from which oracles were derived (Leg. de Christ, 26),
footnote 1 Lucian gives the Cynic a Roland for his Oliver. Bacis was a title rather than a name, and in early Greece prophets who bore it were little less numerous than the Sibyls. Naturally it was a convenient tag for a spurious oracle, whether composed with fraudulent intention or, as often in Aristophanes, for fun. 2 Below (§ 33), Proteus speaks of being “commingled with the ether.”
