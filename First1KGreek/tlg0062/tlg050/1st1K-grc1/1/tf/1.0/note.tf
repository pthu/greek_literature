footnote 1 Erigone; her dog Maera guided her to the spot where Icarius lay buried. He had been slain by drunken shepherds to whom he had given wine that Dionysus had taught him how to make. After her suicide Erigone became Virgo, and Maera, it would seem from Lucian’s κυνίδιον, Procyn (Canis
footnote 1 Zeus was not only born in Crete, but buried there, in more than one place. His critics in Lucian several times refer to this fact (Timon, 4; Zeus Rants, 45). Lucian very

Learchus was killed by his father Athamas. 2 In Icaromenippus, 27 (II, 312) a similar list of “alien gods of doubtful status” is given, in which, besides Pan, Attis, and Sabazius, we find the Corybantes. For Lucian’s conception of them, see the note on The Dance, 8 (p. 220, n. 2). Here only one Cory bas is remarked in the sacred precincts.

On the other hand, the god is styled Scythian Thε Scutjoam 1 and 4, and is the passage before us, us though he is ascribed to

footnote 1 Polydamas, a gigantic pancratiast, was said to have killed lions with his bare hands and stopped chariots at full speed by laying hold of them. Pausanias (VI, 5, 1) mentions his statue at Olympia, made by Lysippus, but does not speak of its healing the sick. But about the Thasian statue of Theagenes, who won 1400 crowns as boxer, pancratiast, and runner, and was reputed to be a son of Heracles, we hear not only from Pausanias (VI, 11, 6—9) but from Oenomaus (in Euseb., Praep. Evang., V, 34, 6—9) and Dio Chrysostom in his Rhodiaeus (XXXI, 95—97). After his death, when an enemy whipped the statue at night, it fell on him and killed him; so it was tried for murder, and flung into the sea. Har-

At Athens, the name of a phyle, or tribe, would go in the first blank of the preamble, as “exercising the prytany”; but Olympus has no tribes, and anyhow Zeus should come first. So his name is set down there. The next two offices might now be crossed off; for as Zeus presides
