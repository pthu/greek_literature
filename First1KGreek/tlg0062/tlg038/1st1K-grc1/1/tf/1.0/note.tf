8095	footnote Available in photographs: r, UPN. (r lost as far as τινος ἄλλου, c. 18 fin. Beginning supplied by late hand g). 1 The scholiast thinks this Celsus the writer of the True Word, an attack upon Christianity, to which Origen replied in his eight books contra Celsum. He is certainly identical with the man whom Origen himself believed to be the author of that work, who, he says, van an Epicurean living under Hadrian and the Antonines, author also of a treatise against

Artemidorus (Dream-book 1, 69) says that “ if you dream of Pythagoreans, physiognomonics, astragalomants, tyromants, gyromants, coscinomants, morphoscopes, chiroscopes, lecanomants, or necyomants, you must consider all that they say false and unreliable ; for

footnote 1 Podaleirius and his brother Machaon, the Homerie healers (Iliad 11, 833), were sons of Asclepius and lived in Tricca (now Trikkala), Thessaly. According to the Sack of Ilium (Evelyn-White, Hesiod, p. 524) Machaon apecialized in surgery, Podaleirius in diagnosis and general Practice.
footnote 1 προῳκοδομημένην β edd. But this is inconsistent with the previous description. The pool is merely casual water; after it has served its turn as the prima fons et origo mali, we hear nothing more of it.

footnote 1 αἰγεου β. 2 συντεθειμένου Bekker: συντεθειμένον MSS. 1 S. Hippolytus (Refut. omn. Haeres. IV. 28—42) contains a highly interesting section “against sorcerers,” inclunding (34) a treatment of this subject, It is very evidently not his own work; and K. F. Hermann thought it derived from the treatise by Celsus. Ganschinietz, in Harnackʼs Texte und Untersuchungen 39, 2, has disputed this, but upon grounds
footnote 1 Alexanderʼs price was high. Amphilochus got but two obols (one-fourth as much) at Mallus. According to Lucian
footnote 1 An inscription from Amastris (C.IG. 4149) honours “Tiberius Claudius Lepidus, Chief Priest of Pontus and President of the Metropolis of Pontus” (i. e. Amastris). This can be no other than the Lepidus of Lucian. The priesthood was that of Augustus. Amastris is almost due N. of Angora, on the Black Sea, W. of Abonoteichus.

footnote 1 καὶ ὡς ἀκούσαντες γ, edd. But ὡς was added by someone who thought that καὶ was the conjunction. Its real force becomes apparent if one transposes thus: τὰ δὲ καὶ ἀκούσαντες ὡς ἰδόντες διηγούμενοι.

footnote 1 Supplement by A.M.H. (after Fritzsche). The preceding μὲν and the following γὰρ prove a gap in the text, which one would expect to be of 17–19 letters—a line in the γ β archetype.
footnote 1 Hereditary priesthoods in the Eleusinian mysteries. 2 As Pythagoras had a golden thigh (Plutarch, Numa 65; Aelian, Var. Hist., 2, 26), a believer in metempsychosis might think that Alexander was a reincarnation of bythagoras.

Details are uncertain; so is the exact date, which was probably between 167 and 169. On the column of Marcus Aurelius in Rome, one of the scenes depicts two animals swimming aoross a river, near a boat. These have been thought to be the lions of the oracle, and

But for οὔτε ὅλως β has οὔτε ἄλλῳ—the correction introduced in the wrong place. 3 οὐ ῥᾳδίως β. 4 Text Γ: μορφεῦ· μάργουλος ἰσχιάγχνε χι φι φάος δα U (β group). B reads as U, but βάργονλος and δάος. 1 Democritus of Abdera is adduced as a typical hardheaded sceptic; see above, c. 17, and the lover of Lies, 32 (iii. p. 369). 2 The oracle seems to contain some Greek, in the two

footnote 1 Αὔειτος Burmeister: ἄνεκτος β, αὐτὸς γ 1 Iliad, 2, 855. 2 Tiberius Julius Eupator succeeded Rhoemetalces as King of the (Cimmerian) Bosporus, on the Tauric Chersonese ; its capital was Panticapaeum (Kertch). The period of his reign is about A.D. 154—171. At this time the kingdom seems to have been paying tribute to the Scythians annually as well as to the Empire (Toxaris, 44).
