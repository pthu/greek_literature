3962	footnote 1 The Olympic games were timed to come at tyhe full of the moon, and the cremation took place at moon-rise (Peregr., 36). 2 By dividing Apollo's question and emphasising the negative in the second part, the tranalation seeks to reproduce the ambiguity of Zeus's reply, which in the Greek is sufficiently
footnote 1 The expression is unusual, and possibly wrong. Various conjectures are πολλὰ καὶ τοιαῦτα, πολλὰ τοιαῦτα, and (Capps) ἄλλα πολλὰ καὶ ταῦτα. Perhaps πολλὰ κατ᾿ αὐτά (i.e. τὰ γιγνόμενα) ?
footnote 1 οἷόν τε after ὑποβαλέσθαι Mras: after χαλινὸν MSS. 2 τε Fritzsche: γε MSS. 3 ἐκτρέποντες N, edd.; but cf. Peregr., 25.
footnote 1 δ᾿ οὖν Jacobitz: γοῦν MSS. 1 The word is chosen because specially appropriate to Cynic “dogs.” 2 The seven were the Seven Sages, who as listed by Plato in the Protagoras (343 A) were Thales of Miletus, Pittacus of
footnote 1 μικτὸ Ν: μικρὸν ΓΒ.
footnote 1 παῖσι Ν: πᾶσι ΓΜΗΧΒϹ. 2 καινὰς Γ: κενὰς Ν: τινὰς BC. Cf. Icarom., 30.
footnote 1 οὐ ΝΓ1, edd.: ἢ Γ2 BA. 2 οἶόν τε ΓM.
footnote 1 Fritzsche reads καὶ λήσειν ἐλπίσωσιν. But Lucian is thinking of incidents like that in his Symp., 15 (I, p. 426). 2 ἂν Bélin; not in MSS. 1 There is here an allusion to “Scarabee”; see below, § 30. 2 Paris. 3 Plato, Republ., V, 459 E.
footnote 1 ἀξιῳ Ν: ἀξιῶν ΓΜΗΧΒϹ.
footnote 1 σοι Fritzsche: τοι MSS.
footnote 1 ὑπονέφελοι edd.: ἐπινέφελοι MSS. 2 ἢ πῶς Bekker: ὅπως MSS.
footnote 1 δὴ Gesner: δὲ MSS. 2 εἶδεν Fritzsche: not in MSS.
footnote 1 αὐτὸν. || ἀνόμοιον, ὦ Harmon: αὐτονόμῳ. || νοῶ MSS. 2 ἐπιγνάψας Γ2Χ2ΗΒΑ: ἐπιγράψας ΓΧ1Ν. 3 In Γ the double point (:) indicating a change of speaker follows φησίν, not λογος.
footnote 1 δραπετίς (N) edd. Prior to Bekker. 2 μισητέον: ξεινοδόκον Γ, thus giving (by the double point) ξεινοδόκον . . . παράσχῃ to the Wife. Other MSS. and all previous editions give these words to Hermes, reading μισητέον ὃς ξεινοδόκον. 3 τῷ καταράτῳ Harmon: τοῦ καταράτου MSS.
footnote 1 ἄγριον Fritzsche: ἀγρίου MSS. 2 Γ has double points after ἔχει and τρύφος, but the fact that μὴ θαυμάσῃς is addressed to one person favours running the speech on rather than (e.g.) giving θέρμους . . . τρύφος to ΔΕΣΠΟΤΗΣ B. 3 Double point in Γ.
footnote 1 τυγχάνεις Γ1: τυγχάνεις ὤν Γ2, cett., Cf. Plato, Gorg., 502 B and Rep. 369 B, cited by Goodwin, G. M. T., § 902, and references in F. Karsten, de Ellipseos Usu Luc. (1889), p. 36, including from Lucian Eun., 2, Abd., 15, Vit. Auct., 19; cf. also below, Eun., 8.
footnote 1 MSS. add ὁ (not in N) τῶν κωμικῶν εἶς, which I excise as a patent gloss, and a mistaken one. 2 μαστιγωθέντε De Jong: μαστιγωθέντα MSS. 1 The book called Three-Headed was an attack on Athens, Sparta, and Thebes, attributed to Theopompus (cf. below, p. 409) but probably written by Anaximenes. 2 The Triphales of Aristophanes, supposed to have been a scurrilous satire on Alcibiades.
