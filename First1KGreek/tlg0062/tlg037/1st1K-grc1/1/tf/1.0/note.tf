4091	footnote Available in photographs: UPNZ. The piece is now wanting in Γ. 1 δόξαις Struve: δόξης γ, δόξεις β.
footnote 1 ὄρειον β. 2 τό γε παρʼ ἡμῶν ἐξαρετόν σοι β, edd. Cf. Navigium 24. 3 α ρήσεις β. Cf. θήραμα, c. 2. ἔκπνους β.
footnote 1 τί γάρ Sauppe : εἰ γὰρ MSS.
footnote 1 Tha Sidonian merchant was exaggerating, but there was truth in his tale. From Persepolis, by crossing the mountains to the head of the Persian Gulf one could pick up a traderoute that led from Alexandria on the Tigris (Charax) to Petra (see Pliny 6, 145), whence one could get to Rhinocolura, and so to Egypt. This would have been much shorter than
footnote 1 A table-mountain captured by Alexander on his way to India, 11 stades high at its lowest point, according to Arrian (Alex. 4, 28), Cunningham identifies it as Ranigat. Tomaschek considers the Greek name derived from Sanscrit
footnote 1 ἕπεσθαί οἱ β, edd. 2 φήσει A.M.H.: καὶ φήσει vulg., καί φησιν MSS. 1 The thought is expressed in Works and Days, 289 “The immortal gods have put sweat before virtue ;” but Lucianʼs wording is closer to the famous line of Epicharmus qaotedd (just after the passage from Hesiod) in Xenophon's
footnote 1 Κριτίον Dinddorf: Κριτίαν β, Κράτητα γ. 2 λιπαρὲς β. But cf. Hermotimus 24, Hesychius, and Soph. Electra, 451.
footnote 1 ἀφείη Jacobs: ἀφίῃ γβ.
footnote 1 Iliad 6, 142. 2 Socrates, in the Apology of Plato, says that when Chaerephon in his zeal “asked whether anyone was wiser than I, the Pythia responded that nobody was wiser” (21 A).
footnote 1 The saying in full was ἀνίπτοις ποσὶν ἀναβαίνων ἐκὶ τὸ στέγος (going up to the roof with unwashed feet), and so can
footnote 1 ἢ A.M.H.: ἡ β, καὶ γ. 2 ἔργον vulg.: ἔρνα MSS. 3 ἢ (twice) A.M.H.: ἡ MSS.
footnote 1 μέτει Bekker: μετὰ MSS. 1 Two of the terms require a word of comment: κἆτα means “and then,” not “eftsoons,” and the peculiarly Attie
footnote 1 ψεγέσθω Hermann : λεγέσθω MSS. 2 ἐπ᾿ ἀκαιρίμαν Valckenaer: ἐπὶ καιρήματι Ω, ἐπὶ καὶ ῥῆμα B. 1 l.e., declamations.
footnote 1 That is to say, before the Flood.
footnote 1 ἀναπηδάτωσαν Sommerbrodt : πηδάτωσαν MSS. 2 ἐλεγχθῇ A.M.H., ἐνεχθῇ MSS. 3 ἐπστρέψοντα Bekker: ἐπιστρέφοντα MSS. 1 The word chorus here approaches the sense that it has in Libanius, where it designates the different bands of scholara attached to the various professors at Athens. So Aelian (Var. Hist.: 3, 19) says of Aristotle that he gathered about him a chorus of pupils, and set upon Plato. Cf. Plato, prot. 315 B.
footnote 1 ἑταιρεῖν Bekker.
footnote 1 Desiderius, Desire. 2 Castor and Pollux. This passage is the corner-stone of the argument that Pollux is the person at whom Lucian is hitting.
