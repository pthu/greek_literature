4644	footnote 1 So ΓΕΜ: κατὰ τιμάρχου added in Γ (marg.) Ν. περὶ τῆς ἀποφράδος ἢ κατὰ τιμάρχου CF. In the alternative form of the title, κατ᾿ Ἀτιμάρχου may be what was originally intended. Cf. § 27, n. 1 As Lucian explains below (12—13), an apophras hêmera, or “nefandous day,” like a dies nefastus among the Latins, was a day of ill-omen on which no courts were held and no business affairs transacted. But the fact that a day can be called apophras does not in itself justify calling a man apophras, particularly as the word is of the feminine gender; and that is
footnote 1 Ὀροδοκίδην ΓΕ: Ὁροδοικίδην Ν: Ὀροδοικίδην edd. 1 See G. L. Hendrickson. “Archilochus and Catullus,” Class. Philol. (1925), 155—157. With the aid of Catullus 40 he is able to identify the poem from which Lucian quotes with the one from which we have the fragment addressed to
footnote 1 ὑποστελλομένου. Α. 2 Μίσθωνα MSS., corrected du Soul from adv. Ind., 23. But N has ἡμῖν θέων there; and possibly the name was Μένθων, a nick nickname. Cf. Lex. 12. 1 On the habits of the tumble-bug, or dung-beetle, see, the beginning of the Peace of Aristophanes. 2 Cf. Runaways, 13. 3 Ariphrades was an Athenian whom Aristophanes pilloried for perverted relations with women. The Sybarite Hemitheon
footnote 1 γε Fritzsche: τε MSS. 2 μηδὲν ἄν De Jong, and possibly Γ1: μηδένα Γ2, cett. 1 We do not know the play in which Exposure appeared as prologue and have no other information in the matter.
footnote 1 ἀνὴρ MSS., corrected by Jacobitz. 2 Text ΓΕΝ: τῶν ὑπὲρ τοὐ Πυθαγόρου ἐκείνων λόγων MFA. 3 Lacuna G. Hermann: not indicated MSS. πάρουσα Headlam, θεὸς οὖσα Cobet. 4 ἔχουσι ἔχωσι ΓΕΝΑ.
footnote 1 The text is that of N, interpreted by adding a comma after αὐτούς and writing τό τε for τότε. The full stop is set after ἔναγχος in ΓA(MFE) and previous editions. But ἐνθένδε makes an awkward anacoluthon with what follows (hence ἔνθεν δὲ ΓΑ); moreover, τότε ἔναγχος is neither idiomatic (hence the omission of τότε in MF) nor consistent with ποτέ (6) and τοῦ πάλαι ἐκείνου γέλωτος (8).

footnote 1 ἐφ᾿ ἡμέρος ἐκείνης Herwerden. 1 The nickname “Buskin” was given to Theramenes. “Seventh Day” cannot be identified, and the other nickname is corrupted in the Greek text. 2 Stripped its manifest disingenuousness (for comparison includes both simile and metaphor, and the use of simile would have been entirely unexceptionable), this amounts to defending what he said as a legitimate use of metaphor, like calling man “Buskin.” The argument would be valid if he had called the man “Apophras hêmera !” But since we may safely say that he addressed or spoke about him
footnote 1 This man played parts like that of the Odysseus who, as we are told in The Dance, § 83, had his head broken by the pantomimic dancer who was enacting Ajax gone mad. Such parts did not involve dancing (cf. ὑποκρίνων, above), but were not silent— point made perfectly clear by another allusion to them in § 25 of this piece. Three of the rôles in which

footnote 1 After ἀθηνιῶ MSS. have τὸ Ἀθηπῶν ἐπιθυμῶ, omitted in ed. Flor., 1496. 2 χειροβλήμαοθαι MSS., corrected by Cobet. 1 Except for rhesimeter (to speak for a measured time, as in court), which Lucian's Lexiphanes usea (Lex., 9), these words are found only here. Their meaning is: bromologous: stench-mouthed. tropomasthletes: oily-mannered fellows. athenio: to yearn for Athens.

footnote 1 καταριθμήσεις Lehmann: καταριθμήσειν MSS. 1 Timarchus is the man whom Aeschines castigated for his vices in an extant speech. From the wording of this passage it has been very generally inferred that the name of Lucian’s butt was Timarchus. That, however, would be a singular

footnote 1 The quaint conceit that with a trident all three might be despatched at a blow undoubtedly embellished a rhetorical “exercise” like Lucianʼs own Tyrannicide or Disowned. 2 On the book entitled Tricaranus (“ricipitine,” or “Three-Headed”) see p. 96, n. 9.
footnote 1 ἕν Bekker: εἴ MSS. 1 Apparently, Lucian's hero had sold to the old man as “Tisiasʼ Handbook” a work on rhetoric which he had himsef forged. Both Tisias and his master Corax, the founder of
