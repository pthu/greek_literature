3864	footnote Available in photographs: r,UN. 1 A double allusion. The Niobe story has already been introduced by the mention of Mount Sipylus, where Niobe was turned into stone; and now, by styling her the daughter
footnote 1 μέντοι Lehmann: μέν σοι MSS. 1 Furtwangler, Greek and Roman Sculpture, pl. xxv, opposite p. 91. 2 The story, which can be traced back to Posidonius, is told at greater length in the Amores.
footnote 1 No copy of the Sosandra is known, nor is it clear whether she was a goddess or a woman. 2 For the beautiful head in Bologna that a believed to be copied from this statue (a work in bronze, dedicated on the Acropolis by certain Lemmians) see Furtwängler, Masterpieces of Greek Sculpture, pl. i—iii, and Fig. 3.
footnote 1 ἰοβλέφρον du Soul: τὸ βλέφαρον MSS. 1 Painted as one of the Twelve Gods in the portico of Zeus Eleutherius at Athens (Pausanias 1, 3, 3; Pliny 35, 129). 2 “Above the Cassotis is a building with paintings by Polygnotus; it was dedicated by the Cnidians, and is called by the Delphians the Club-room (Lesche, “place of talk”), because here they used of old to meet and talk over both mythological and more serious subjects. . . . Cassandra herself is seated on the ground and is holding the image of
footnote 1 οἱ δὲ γυροὶ added from the margin of Γ. 1 The Trojan Palladium was “dropt from the skies” according to the myth (Apollodorus 3, 12, 3); so also the image of Athena Tauropolos at Halae in Attica, that was thought to have been brought there from the country of the Taurians where it fell (Euripides, Iph. in Taur. 87, 977, 986).
footnote 1 Panthea, “the woman of Susa, who is said to have been the fairest in Asia,” whose story is told in the Cyropaedia (4, 6, 11; 5, 1, 2—18; 6,1,33—51; 6,4,2—11; 7,3, 2—16). Polystratus

footnote 1 τότε δὴ τότε du Soul τότε δὴ τίποτε MSS. 2 τάχιστα Jacobitz: ταῦτα MSS. 1 Pandion's daughter is the nightingale: the inimitable πολυηχέα comes from Homer (Odyssey 19, 521).
footnote 1 συντελεσθέν: corrupt. An infinitive is wanted, e.g. συντιθέναι. The usual reading, γραφικῶς συντελεσθέν, leaves κάλλη τοσαῦτα floating.

footnote 1 οὖν Fritzche: not in MSS.
footnote 1 τὰς should probably be excised. 1 Wife, or disciple, of Pythagoras, herself a philosophical writer of note. 2 Diotima, a priestess of Mantinea, probably fictitious, for we hear of her only through Plato in the Symposium (201 D). Socrates says there that she was wise in Love, and ascribes
